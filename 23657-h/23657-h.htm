<p><span class="dcap">n</span> 1914, it was enemy
aliens.</p>

<p>In 1930, it was
Wobblies.</p>

<p>In 1957, it was fellow
travelers.</p>

<p>And, in 1971....</p>

<p>"They could be anywhere," Andrew
J. Burris said, with an expression
which bordered on exasperated
horror. "They could be all around
us. Heaven only knows."</p>

<p>He pushed his chair back from his
desk and stood up&mdash;a chunky little
man with bright blue eyes and large
hands. He paced to the window and
looked out at Washington, and then
he came back to the desk. A persistent
office rumor held that he had
become head of the FBI purely because
he happened to have an initial
<i>J</i> in his name, but in his case the <i>J</i>
stood for Jeremiah. And, at the moment,
his tone expressed all the hopelessness
of that Old Testament
prophet's lamentations.</p>

<p>"We're helpless," he said, looking
at the young man with the crisp
brown hair who was sitting across
the desk. "That's what it is, we're
helpless."</p>

<p>Kenneth Malone tried to look dependable.
"Just tell me what to do,"
he said.</p>

<p>"You're a good agent, Kenneth,"
Burris said. "You're one of the best.
That's why you've been picked for
this job. And I want to say that I
picked you personally. Believe me,
there's never been anything like it
before."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," Malone said at
random. He was twenty-eight, and
he had been an FBI agent for three
years. In that time, he had, among
other things, managed to break up
a gang of smugglers, track down a
counterfeiting ring, and capture
three kidnapers. For reasons which
he could neither understand nor explain,
no one seemed willing to attribute
his record to luck.</p>

<p>"I know you will," Burris said.
"And if anybody can crack this case,
Malone, you're the man. It's just that&mdash;everything
sounds so <i>impossible</i>.
Even after all the conferences we've
had."</p>

<p>"Conferences?" Malone said
vaguely. He wished the chief would
get to the point. Any point. He
smiled gently across the desk and
tried to look competent and dependable
and reassuring. Burris' expression
didn't change.</p>

<p>"You'll get the conference tapes
later," Burris said. "You can study
them before you leave. I suggest you
study them very carefully, Malone.
Don't be like me. Don't get confused."
He buried his face in his
hands. Malone waited patiently. After
a few seconds, Burris looked up.
"Did you read books when you were
a child?" he asked.</p>

<p>Malone said: "What?"</p>

<p>"Books," Burris said. "When you
were a child. Read them."</p>

<p>"Sure I did," Malone said.
"'Bomba the Jungle Boy,' and 'Doolittle,'
and 'Lucky Starr,' and 'Little
Women'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Little Women'?"</p>

<p>"When Beth died," Malone said,
"I wanted to cry. But I didn't.
My father said big boys don't
cry."</p>

<p>"And your father was right,"
Burris said. "Why, when I was a
... never mind. Forget about Beth
and your father. Think about 'Lucky
Starr' for a minute. Remember
him?"</p>

<p>"Sure," Malone said. "I liked
those books. You know, it's funny,
but the books you read when you're
a kid, they kind of stay with you.
Know what I mean? I can still remember
that one about Venus, for
instance. Gee, that was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind about Venus, too,"
Burris said sharply. "Keep your
mind on the problem."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Malone said. He paused.
"What problem, sir?" he added.</p>

<p>"The problem we're discussing,"
Burris said. He gave Malone a
bright, blank stare. "Just listen to
me."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"All right, then." Burris took a
deep breath. He seemed nervous.
Once again he stood up and went
to the window. This time, he spoke
without turning. "Remember how
everybody used to laugh about spaceships,
and orbital satellites, and life
on other planets? That was just in
those 'Lucky Starr' books. That was
all just for kids, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," Malone
said slowly.</p>

<p>"Sure it was all for kids," Burris
said. "It was laughable. Nobody took
it seriously."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>somebody</i> must&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You just keep quiet and listen,"
Burris said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Malone said.</p>

<p>Burris nodded. His hands were
clasped behind his back. "We're not
laughing any more, are we, Malone?"
he said without moving.</p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>"Well, are we?"</p>

<p>"Did you want me to answer,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did!" Burris snapped.</p>

<p>"You told me to keep quiet
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind what I told you,"
Burris said. "Just do what I told
you."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Malone said. "No,
sir," he added after a second.</p>

<p>"No, sir, what?" Burris asked
softly.</p>

<p>"No, sir, we're not laughing any
more," Malone said.</p>

<p>"Ah," Burris said. "And why
aren't we laughing any more?"</p>

<p>There was a little pause. Malone
said, tentatively: "Because there's
nothing to laugh about, sir?"</p>

<p>Burris whirled. "On the head!"
he said happily. "You've hit the nail
on the head, Kenneth. I knew I could
depend on you." His voice grew serious
again, and thoughtful. "We're
not laughing any more because
there's nothing to laugh about. We
have orbital satellites, and we've
landed on the Moon with an atomic
rocket. The planets are the next step,
and after that the stars. Man's heritage,
Kenneth. The stars. And the
stars, Kenneth, belong to Man&mdash;not
to the Soviets!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Malone said soberly.</p>

<p>"So," Burris said, "we should
learn not to laugh any more. But
have we?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"We haven't," Burris said with
decision. "Can you read my mind?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," Malone said.</p>

<p>"Can I read your mind?"</p>

<p>Malone hesitated. At last he said:
"Not that I know of, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't," Burris snapped.
"And can any of us read each other's
mind?"</p>

<p>Malone shook his head. "No, sir,"
he said.</p>

<p>Burris nodded. "That's the problem,"
he said. "That's the case I'm
sending you out to crack."</p>

<p>This time, the silence was a long
one.</p>

<p>At last, Malone said: "What problem,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Mind reading," Burris said.
"There's a spy at work in the Nevada
plant, Kenneth. And the spy
is a telepath."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The video tapes were very clear
and very complete. There were a
great many of them, and it was long
after nine o'clock when Kenneth
Malone decided to take a break and
get some fresh air. Washington was
a good city for walking, even at
night, and Malone liked to walk.
Sometimes he pretended, even to
himself, that he got his best ideas
while walking, but he knew perfectly
well that wasn't true. His best
ideas just seemed to come to him,
out of nowhere, precisely as the situation
demanded them.</p>

<p>He was just lucky, that was all.
He had a talent for being lucky. But
nobody would ever believe that. A
record like his was spectacular, even
in the annals of the FBI, and Burris
himself believed that the record
showed some kind of superior ability.</p>

<p>Malone knew that wasn't true, but
what could he do about it? After all,
he didn't want to resign, did he? It
was kind of romantic and exciting
to be an FBI agent, even after three
years. A man got a chance to travel
around a lot and see things, and it
was interesting. The pay was pretty
good, too.</p>

<p>The only trouble was that, if he
didn't quit, he was going to have to
find a telepath.</p>

<p>The notion of telepathic spies just
didn't sound right to Malone. It
bothered him in a remote sort of
way. Not that the idea of telepathy
itself was alien to him&mdash;after all, he
was even more aware than the average
citizen that research had been
going on in that field for something
over a quarter of a century, and that
the research was even speeding up.</p>

<p>But the cold fact that a telepathy-detecting
device had been invented
somehow shocked his sense of
propriety, and his notions of privacy.
It wasn't decent, that was all.</p>

<p>There ought to be something sacred,
he told himself angrily.</p>

<p>He stopped walking and looked
up. He was on Pennsylvania Avenue,
heading toward the White House.</p>

<p>That was no good. He went to the
corner and turned off, down the
block. He had, he told himself, nothing
at all to see the President about.</p>

<p>Not yet, anyhow.</p>

<p>The streets were dark and very
peaceful. <i>I get my best ideas while
walking</i>, Malone said without convincing
himself. He thought back to
the video tapes.</p>

<p>The report on the original use of
the machine itself had been on one
of the first tapes, and Malone could
still see and hear it. That was one
thing he did have, he reflected; his
memory was pretty good.</p>

<p>Burris had been the first speaker
on the tapes, and he'd given the
serial and reference number in a cold,
matter-of-fact voice. His face had
been perfectly blank, and he looked
just like the head of the FBI people
were accustomed to seeing on their
TV and newsreel screens. Malone
wondered what had happened to him
between the time the tapes had been
made and the time he'd sent for
Malone.</p>

<p>Maybe the whole notion of telepathy
was beginning to get him, Malone
thought.</p>

<p>Burris recited the standard tape
opening in a rapid mumble: "Any
person or agent unauthorized for this
tape please refrain from viewing
further, under penalties as prescribed
by law." Then he looked off, out
past the screen to the left, and said:
"Dr. Thomas O'Connor, of Westinghouse
Laboratories. Will you
come here, Dr. O'Connor?"</p>

<p>Dr. O'Connor came into the lighted
square of screen slowly, looking
all around him. "This is very fascinating,"
he said, blinking in the
lamplight. "I hadn't realized that
you people took so many precautions&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was, Malone thought, somewhere
between fifty and sixty, tall
and thin with skin so transparent
that he nearly looked like a living
X ray. He had pale blue eyes and
pale white hair and, Malone thought,
if there ever were a contest for the
best-looking ghost, Dr. Thomas
O'Connor would win it hands&mdash;or
phalanges&mdash;down.</p>

<p>"This is all necessary for the national
security," Burris said, a little
sternly.</p>

<p>"Oh," Dr. O'Connor said quickly,
"I realize that, of course. Naturally.
I can certainly see that."</p>

<p>"Let's go ahead, shall we?" Burris
said.</p>

<p>O'Connor nodded. "Certainly.
Certainly."</p>

<p>Burris said: "Well, then," and
paused. After a second he started
again: "Now, Dr. O'Connor, would
you please give us a sort of verbal
run-down on this for our records?"</p>

<p>"Of course," Dr. O'Connor said.
He smiled into the video cameras
and cleared his throat. "I take it you
don't want an explanation of how
this machine works. I mean: you
don't want a technical exposition,
do you?"</p>

<p>"No," Burris said, and added:
"Not by any means. Just tell us what
it does."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Dr. O'Connor suddenly reminded
Malone of a professor he'd had in
college for one of the law courses.
He had, Malone thought, the same
smiling gravity of demeanor, the
same condescending attitude of absolute
authority. It was clear that Dr.
O'Connor lived in a world of his
own, a world that was not even
touched by the common run of
men.</p>

<p>"Well," he began, "to put it very
simply, the device indicates whether
or not a man's mental ... ah ...
processes are being influenced by
outside ... by outside influences."
He gave the cameras another little
smile. "If you will allow me, I will
demonstrate on the machine itself."</p>

<p>He took two steps that carried him
out of camera range, and returned
wheeling a large heavy-looking box.
Dangling from the metal covering
were a number of wires and attachments.
A long cord led from the box
to the floor, and snaked out of sight
to the left.</p>

<p>"Now," Dr. O'Connor said. He
selected a single lead, apparently,
Malone thought, at random. "This
electrode&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just a moment, doctor," Burris
said. He was eying the machine with
a combination of suspicion and awe.
"A while back you mentioned something
about 'outside influences.'
Just what, specifically, does that
mean?"</p>

<p>With some regret, Dr. O'Connor
dropped the lead. "Telepathy," he
said. "By outside influences, I meant
influences on the mind, such as
telepathy or mind reading of some
nature."</p>

<p>"I see," Burris said. "You can detect
a telepath with this machine."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, some kind of a mind reader
anyhow," Burris said. "We won't
quarrel about terms."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," Dr. O'Connor
said. The smile he turned on Burris
was as cold and empty as the inside
of Orbital Station One. "What I
meant was ... if you will permit
me to continue ... that we cannot
detect any sort of telepath or mind
reader with this device. To be frank,
I very much wish that we could; it
would make everything a great deal
simpler. However, the laws of
psionics don't seem to operate that
way."</p>

<p>"Well, then," Burris said, "what
does the thing do?" His face wore
a mask of confusion. Momentarily,
Malone felt sorry for his chief. He
could remember how he'd felt, himself,
when that law professor had
come up with a particularly baffling
question in class.</p>

<p>"This machine," Dr. O'Connor
said with authority, "detects the
slight variations in mental activity
that occur when a person's mind is
<i>being</i> read."</p>

<p>"You mean, if my mind were being
read right now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not right now," Dr. O'Connor
said. "You see, the bulk of this machine
is in Nevada; the structure is
both too heavy and too delicate for
transport. And there are other qualifications&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I meant theoretically," Burris
said.</p>

<p>"Theoretically," Dr. O'Connor began,
and smiled again, "if your mind
were being read, this machine would
detect it, supposing that the machine
were in operating condition and all
of the other qualifications had been
met. You see, Mr. Burris, no matter
how poor a telepath a man may be,
he has some slight ability&mdash;even if
only very slight&mdash;to detect the fact
that his mind is being read."</p>

<p>"You mean, if somebody were
reading my mind, I'd know it?" Burris
said. His face showed, Malone
realized, that he plainly disbelieved
this statement.</p>

<p>"You would know it," Dr. O'Connor
said, "but you would never
know you knew it. To elucidate: in
a normal person&mdash;like you, for instance,
or even like myself&mdash;the state
of having one's mind read merely
results in a vague, almost subconscious
feeling of irritation, something
that could easily be attributed to
minor worries, or fluctuations in
one's hormonal balance. The hormonal
balance, Mr. Burris, is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you," Burris said with a
trace of irritation. "I know what
hormones are."</p>

<p>"Ah. Good," Dr. O'Connor said
equably. "In any case, to continue:
this machine interprets those specific
feelings as indications that the mind
is being ... ah ... 'eavesdropped'
upon."</p>

<p>You could almost see the quotation
marks around what Dr. O'Connor
considered slang dropping into
place, Malone thought.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"I see," Burris said with a disappointed
air. "But what do you
mean, it won't detect a telepath?
Have you ever actually worked with
a telepath?"</p>

<p>"Certainly we have," Dr. O'Connor
said. "If we hadn't, how would
we be able to tell that the machine
was, in fact, indicating the presence
of telepathy? The theoretical state of
the art is not, at present, sufficiently
developed to enable us to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see," Burris said hurriedly.
"Only wait a minute."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You mean you've actually got a
real mind reader? You've found one?
One that works?"</p>

<p>Dr. O'Connor shook his head sadly.
"I'm afraid I should have said,
Mr. Burris, that we did once have
one," he admitted. "He was, unfortunately,
an imbecile, with a mental
age between five and six, as nearly
as we were able to judge."</p>

<p>"An imbecile?" Burris said. "But
how were you able to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He could repeat a person's
thoughts word for word," Dr.
O'Connor said. "Of course, he was
utterly incapable of understanding
the meaning behind them. That
didn't matter; he simply repeated
whatever you were thinking. Rather
disconcerting."</p>

<p>"I'm sure," Burris said. "But he
was really an imbecile? There wasn't
any chance of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of curing him?" Dr. O'Connor
said. "None, I'm afraid. We did at
one time feel that there had been a
mental breakdown early in the boy's
life, and, indeed, it's perfectly possible
that he was normal for the first
year or so. The records we did manage
to get on that period, however,
were very much confused, and there
was never any way of telling anything
at all, for certain. It's easy to
see what caused the confusion, of
course: telepathy in an imbecile is
rather an oddity&mdash;and any normal
adult would probably be rather hesitant
about admitting that he was capable
of it. That's why we have not
found another subject; we must
merely sit back and wait for lightning
to strike."</p>

<p>Burris sighed. "I see your problem,"
he said. "But what happened
to this imbecile boy of yours?"</p>

<p>"Very sad," Dr. O'Connor said.
"Six months ago, at the age of fifteen,
the boy simply died. He simply&mdash;gave
up, and died."</p>

<p>"Gave up?"</p>

<p>"That was as good an explanation
as our medical department was able
to provide, Mr. Burris. There was
some malfunction, but&mdash;we like to
say that he simply gave up. Living
became too difficult for him."</p>

<p>"All right," Burris said after a
pause. "This telepath of yours is
dead, and there aren't any more
where he came from. Or if there are,
you don't know how to look for
them. All right. But to get back to
this machine of yours: it couldn't
detect the boy's ability?"</p>

<p>Dr. O'Connor shook his head.
"No, I'm afraid not. We've worked
hard on that problem at Westinghouse,
Mr. Burris, but we haven't
yet been able to find a method of actually
detecting telepaths."</p>

<p>"But you can detect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's right," Dr. O'Connor said.
"We can detect the fact that a man's
mind is being read." He stopped,
and his face became suddenly
morose. When he spoke again, he
sounded guilty, as if he were making
an admission that pained him. "Of
course, Mr. Burris, there's nothing
we can <i>do</i> about a man's mind being
read. Nothing whatever." He essayed
a grin that didn't look very healthy.
"But at least," he said, "you know
you're being spied on."</p>

<p>Burris grimaced. There was a little
silence while Dr. O'Connor stroked
the metal box meditatively, as if it
were the head of his beloved.</p>

<p>At last, Burris said: "Dr. O'Connor,
how sure can you be of all
this?"</p>

<p>The look he received made all the
previous conversation seem as warm
and friendly as a Christmas party by
comparison. It was a look that froze
the air of the room into a solid
chunk, Malone thought, a chunk you
could have chipped pieces from, for
souvenirs, later, when Dr. O'Connor
had gone and you could get into the
room without any danger of being
quick-frozen by the man's unfriendly
eye.</p>

<p>"Mr. Burris," Dr. O'Connor said
in a voice that matched the temperature
of his gaze, "please. Remember
our slogan."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Malone sighed. He fished in his
pocket for a pack of cigarettes, found
one, and extracted a single cigarette.
He stuck it in his mouth and started
fishing in various pockets for his
lighter.</p>

<p>He sighed again. He preferred
cigars, a habit he'd acquired from
the days when he'd filched them
from his father's cigar case, but his
mental picture of the fearless and
alert young FBI agent didn't include
a cigar. Somehow, remembering his
father as neither fearless nor, exactly,
alert&mdash;anyway, not the way the
movies and the TV screens liked to
picture the words&mdash;he had the impression
that cigars looked out of
place on FBI agents.</p>

<p>And it was, in any case, a small
sacrifice to make. He found his lighter
and shielded it from the brisk
wind. He looked out over water at
the Jefferson Memorial, and was surprised
that he'd managed to walk as
far as he had. Then he stopped
thinking about walking, and took a
puff of his cigarette, and forced himself
to think about the job in hand.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Westinghouse gadget
had been declared Ultra Top
Secret as soon as it had been worked
out. Virtually everything was, these
days. And the whole group involved
in the machine and its workings had
been transferred without delay to the
United States Laboratories out in
Yucca Flats, Nevada.</p>

<p>Out there in the desert, there just
wasn't much to do, Malone supposed,
except to play with the machine.
And, of course, look at the scenery.
But when you've seen one desert,
Malone thought confusedly, you've
seen them all.</p>

<p>So, the scientists ran experiments
on the machine, and they made a
discovery of a kind they hadn't been
looking for.</p>

<p>Somebody, they discovered, was
picking the brains of the scientists
there.</p>

<p>Not the brains of the people
working with the telepathy machine.</p>

<p>And not the brains of the people
working on the several other Earth-limited
projects at Yucca Flats.</p>

<p>They'd been reading the minds of
some of the scientists working on
the new and highly classified non-rocket
space drive.</p>

<p>In other words, the Yucca Flats
plant was infested with a telepathic
spy. And how do you go about finding
a telepath? Malone sighed.
Spies that got information in any of
the usual ways were tough enough
to locate. A telepathic spy was a lot
tougher proposition.</p>

<p>Well, one thing about Andrew J.
Burris&mdash;he had an answer for
everything. Malone thought of what
his chief had said: "It takes a thief
to catch a thief. And if the Westinghouse
machine won't locate a telepathic
spy, I know what will."</p>

<p>"What?" Malone had asked.</p>

<p>"It's simple," Burris had said.
"Another telepath. There has to be
one around somewhere. Westinghouse
<i>did</i> have one, after all, and
the Russians <i>still</i> have one. Malone,
that's your job: go out and find me
a telepath."</p>

<p>Burris had an answer for everything,
all right, Malone thought. But
he couldn't see where the answer did
him very much good. After all, if it
takes a telepath to catch a telepath,
how do you catch the telepath you're
going to use to catch the first telepath?</p>

</div>



<p>Malone ran that through his mind
again, and then gave it up. It sounded
as if it should have made sense,
somehow, but it just didn't, and that
was all there was to that.</p>

<p>He dropped his cigarette to the
ground and mashed it out with the
toe of his shoe. Then he looked up.</p>

<p>Out there, over the water, was the
Jefferson Memorial. It stood, white
in the floodlights, beautiful and untouchable
in the darkness. Malone
stared at it. What would Thomas
Jefferson have done in a crisis like
this?</p>

<p>Jefferson, he told himself without
much conviction, would have been
just as confused as he was.</p>

<p>But he'd have had to find a telepath,
Malone thought. Malone determined
that he would do likewise.
If Thomas Jefferson could do it, the
least he, Malone, could do was to
give it a good try.</p>

<p>There was only one little problem:</p>

<p><i>Where</i>, Malone thought, <i>do I
start looking?</i></p>



<hr class="hrchp" />
<h2>II</h2>


<p>Early the next morning, Malone
awoke on a plane, heading across
the continent toward Nevada. He
had gone home to sleep, and he'd
had to wake up to get on the plane,
and now here he was, waking up
again. It seemed, somehow, like a
vicious circle.</p>

<p>The engines hummed gently as
they pushed the big ship through the
middle stratosphere's thinly distributed
molecules. Malone looked out
at the purple-dark sky and set himself
to think out his problem again.</p>

<p>He was still mulling things over
when the ship lowered its landing
gear and rolled to a stop on the big
field near Yucca Flats. Malone
sighed and climbed slowly out of his
seat. There was a car waiting for him
at the airfield, though, and that
seemed to presage a smooth time;
Malone remembered calling Dr.
O'Connor the night before, and congratulated
himself on his foresight.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when he reached
the main gate of the high double
fence that surrounded the more than
ninety square miles of United States
Laboratories, he found out that entrance
into that sanctum sanctorum
of Security wasn't as easy as he'd
imagined&mdash;not even for an FBI man.
His credentials were checked with
the kind of minute care Malone had
always thought people reserved for
disputed art masterpieces, and it was
with a great show of reluctance that
the Special Security guards passed
him inside as far as the office of the
Chief Security Officer.</p>

<p>There, the Chief Security Officer
himself, a man who could have
doubled for Torquemada, eyed Malone
with ill-concealed suspicion
while he called Burris at FBI headquarters
back in Washington.</p>

<p>Burris identified Malone on the
video screen and the Chief Security
Officer, looking faintly disappointed,
stamped the agent's pass and thanked
the FBI chief. Malone had the
run of the place.</p>

<p>Then he had to find a courier jeep.
The Westinghouse division, it seemed,
was a good two miles away.</p>

<p>As Malone knew perfectly well,
the main portion of the entire Yucca
Flats area was devoted solely to research
on the new space drive which
was expected to make the rocket as
obsolete as the blunderbuss&mdash;at least
as far as space travel was concerned.
Not, Malone thought uneasily, that
the blunderbuss had ever been used
for space travel, but&mdash;</p>

<p>He got off the subject hurriedly.
The jeep whizzed by buildings, most
of them devoted to aspects of the
non-rocket drive. The other projects
based at Yucca Flats had to share
what space was left&mdash;and that included,
of course, the Westinghouse
research project.</p>

<p>It turned out to be a single, rather
small white building with a fence
around it. The fence bothered Malone
a little, but there was no need
to worry; this time he was introduced
at once into Dr. O'Connor's office.
It was paneled in wallpaper manufactured
to look like pine, and the
telepathy expert sat behind a large
black desk bigger than any Malone
had ever seen in the FBI offices.
There wasn't a scrap of paper on the
desk; its surface was smooth and
shiny, and behind it the nearly transparent
Dr. Thomas O'Connor was
close to invisible.</p>

<p>He looked, in person, just about
the same as he'd looked on the FBI
tapes. Malone closed the door of the
office behind him, looked for a chair
and didn't find one. In Dr. O'Connor's
office, it was perfectly obvious,
Dr. O'Connor sat down. You stood,
and were uncomfortable.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Malone took off his hat. He reached
across the desk to shake hands
with the telepathy expert, and Dr.
O'Connor gave him a limp and
fragile paw. "Thanks for giving me
a little time," Malone said. "I really
appreciate it." He smiled across the
desk. His feet were already beginning
to hurt.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Dr. O'Connor said,
returning the smile with one of his
own special quick-frozen brand. "I
realize how important FBI work is
to all of us, Mr. Malone. What can
I do to help you?"</p>

<p>Malone shifted his feet. "I'm
afraid I wasn't very specific on the
phone last night," he said. "It wasn't
anything I wanted to discuss over a
line that might have been tapped.
You see, I'm on the telepathy
case."</p>

<p>Dr. O'Connor's eyes widened the
merest trifle. "I see," he said. "Well,
I'll certainly do everything I can to
help you."</p>

<p>"Fine," Malone said. "Let's get
right down to business, then. The
first thing I want to ask you about
is this detector of yours. I understand
it's too big to carry around&mdash;but
how about making a smaller
model?"</p>

<p>"Smaller?" Dr. O'Connor permitted
himself a ghostly chuckle. "I'm
afraid that isn't possible, Mr. Malone.
I would be happy to let you
have a small model of the machine
if we had one available&mdash;more than
happy. I would like to see such a
machine myself, as a matter of fact.
Unfortunately, Mr. Malone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There just isn't one, right?" Malone
said.</p>

<p>"Correct," Dr. O'Connor said.
"And there are a few other factors.
In the first place, the person being
analyzed has to be in a specially
shielded room, such as is used in
encephalographic analysis. Otherwise,
the mental activity of the other
persons around him would interfere
with the analysis." He frowned a
little. "I wish that we knew a bit
more about psionic machines. The
trouble with the present device,
frankly, is that it is partly psionic
and partly electronic, and we can't
be entirely sure where one part
leaves off and the other begins. Very
trying. Very trying indeed."</p>

<p>"I'll bet it is," Malone said sympathetically,
wishing he understood
what Dr. O'Connor was talking
about.</p>

<p>The telepathy expert sighed.
"However," he said, "we keep
working at it." Then he looked at
Malone expectantly.</p>

<p>Malone shrugged. "Well, if I
can't carry the thing around, I guess
that's that," he said. "But here's the
next question: Do you happen to
know the maximum range of a telepath?
I mean: How far away can he
get from another person and still
read his mind?"</p>

<p>Dr. O'Connor frowned again.
"We don't have definite information
on that, I'm afraid," he said.
"Poor little Charlie was rather difficult
to work with. He was mentally
incapable of co-operating in any
way, you see."</p>

<p>"Little Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Charles O'Neill was the name of
the telepath we worked with," Dr.
O'Connor explained.</p>

<p>"I remember," Malone said. The
name had been on one of the tapes,
but he just hadn't associated
"Charles O'Neill" with "Little
Charlie." He felt as if he'd been
caught with his homework undone.
"How did you manage to find him,
anyway?" he said. Maybe, if he knew
how Westinghouse had found their
imbecile-telepath, he'd have some
kind of clue that would enable him
to find one, too. Anyhow, it was
worth a try.</p>

<p>"It wasn't difficult in Charlie's
case," Dr. O'Connor said. He smiled.
"The child babbled all the time, you
see."</p>

<p>"You mean he talked about being
a telepath?"</p>

<p>Dr. O'Connor shook his head impatiently.
"No," he said. "Not at
all. I mean that he babbled. Literally.
Here: I've got a sample recording
in my files." He got up from his
chair and went to the tall gray filing
cabinet that hid in a far corner of
the pine-paneled room. From a drawer
he extracted a spool of common
audio tape, and returned to his
desk.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry we didn't get full video
on this," he said, "but we didn't feel
it was necessary." He opened a panel
in the upper surface of the desk, and
slipped the spool in. "If you like,
there are other tapes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe later," Malone said.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Dr. O'Connor nodded and pressed
the playback switch at the side of the
great desk. For a second the room
was silent.</p>

<p>Then there was the hiss of empty
tape, and a brisk masculine voice that
overrode it:</p>

<p>"Westinghouse Laboratories," it
said, "sixteen April nineteen-seventy.
Dr. Walker speaking. The voice you
are about to hear belongs to Charles
O'Neill: chronological age fourteen
years, three months; mental age, approximately
five years. Further data
on this case will be found in the file
<i>O'Neill</i>."</p>

<p>There was a slight pause, filled
with more tape hiss.</p>

<p>Then the voice began.</p>

<p>"... push the switch for record
... in the park last Wednesday ...
and perhaps a different set of ...
poor kid never makes any sense in
... trees and leaves all sunny with
the ... electronic components of the
reducing stage might be ... not as
predictable when others are around
but ... to go with Sally some night
in the...."</p>

<p>It was a childish, alto voice, gabbling
in a monotone. A phrase
would be spoken, the voice would
hesitate for just an instant, and then
another, totally disconnected phrase
would come. The enunciation and
pronunciation would vary from
phrase to phrase, but the tone remained
essentially the same, drained
of all emotional content.</p>

<p>"... in receiving psychocerebral
impulses there isn't any ... nonsense
and nothing but nonsense all
the ... tomorrow or maybe Saturday
with the girl ... tube might be replaceable
only if ... something
ought to be done for the ... Saturday
would be a good time for ...
work on the schematics tonight
if...."</p>

<p>There was a click as the tape was
turned off, and Dr. O'Connor looked
up.</p>

<p>"It doesn't make much sense,"
Malone said. "But the kid sure has
a hell of a vocabulary for an imbecile."</p>

<p>"Vocabulary?" Dr. O'Connor said
softly.</p>

<p>"That's right," Malone said.
"Where'd an imbecile get words like
'psychocerebral'? I don't think I
know what that means, myself."</p>

<p>"Ah," Dr. O'Connor said. "But
that's not <i>his</i> vocabulary, you see.
What Charlie is doing is simply repeating
the thoughts of those around
him. He jumps from mind to mind,
simply repeating whatever he receives."
His face assumed the expression
of a man remembering a
bad taste in his mouth. "That's how
we found him out, Mr. Malone," he
said. "It's rather startling to look at
a blithering idiot and have him suddenly
repeat the very thought that's
in your mind."</p>

<p>Malone nodded unhappily. It
didn't seem as if O'Connor's information
was going to be a lot of help
as far as catching a telepath was concerned.
An imbecile, apparently,
would give himself away if he were
a telepath. But nobody else seemed
to be likely to do that. And imbeciles
didn't look like very good material
for catching spies with.</p>

<p>Then he brightened. "Is it possible
that the spy we're looking for
really isn't a spy?"</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"I mean, suppose he's an imbecile,
too? I doubt whether an imbecile
would really be a spy, if you see what
I mean."</p>

<p>Dr. O'Connor appeared to consider
the notion. After a little while he
said: "It is, I suppose, possible. But
the readings on the machine don't
give us the same timing as they did
in Charlie's case&mdash;or even the same
sort of timing."</p>

<p>"I don't quite follow you," Malone
said. Truthfully, he felt about
three miles behind. But perhaps
everything would clear up soon. He
hoped so. On top of everything else,
his feet were now hurting a lot
more.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if I describe one of the
tests we ran," Dr. O'Connor said,
"things will be somewhat clearer."
He leaned back in his chair. Malone
shifted his feet again and transferred
his hat from his right hand to his
left hand.</p>

<p>"We put one of our test subjects
in the insulated room," Dr. O'Connor
said, "and connected him to the
detector. He was to read from a book&mdash;a
book that was not too common.
This was, of course, to obviate the
chance that some other person nearby
might be reading it, or might have
read it in the past. We picked 'The
Blood is the Death,' by Hieronymus
Melanchthon, which, as you may
know, is a very rare book indeed."</p>

<p>"Sure," Malone said. He had
never heard of the book, but he was,
after all, willing to take Dr. O'Connor's
word for it.</p>

<p>The telepathy expert went on:
"Our test subject read it carefully,
scanning rather than skimming.
Cameras recorded the movements of
his eyes in order for us to tell just
what he was reading at any given
moment, in order to correlate what
was going on in his mind with the
reactions of the machine's indicators,
if you follow me."</p>

<p>Malone nodded helplessly.</p>

<p>"At the same time," Dr. O'Connor
continued blithely, "we had
Charlie in a nearby room, recording
his babblings. Every so often, he
would come out with quotations
from 'The Blood is the Death,' and
these quotations corresponded exactly
with what our test subject was
reading at the time, and also corresponded
with the abnormal fluctuations
of the detector."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Dr. O'Connor paused. Something,
Malone realized, was expected of
him. He thought of several responses
and chose one. "I see," he said.</p>

<p>"But the important thing here,"
Dr. O'Connor said, "is the timing.
You see, Charlie was incapable of
continued concentration. He could
not keep his mind focused on another
mind for very long, before he
hopped to still another. The actual
amount of time concentrated on any
given mind at any single given period
varied from a minimum of one
point three seconds to a maximum
of two point six. The timing samples,
when plotted graphically over
a period of several months, formed
a skewed bell curve with a mode at
two point oh seconds."</p>

<p>"Ah," Malone said, wondering if
a skewed bell curve was the same
thing as a belled skew curve, and if
not, why not?</p>

<p>"It was, in fact," Dr. O'Connor
continued relentlessly, "a sudden
variation in those timings which
convinced us that there was another
telepath somewhere in the vicinity.
We were conducting a second set of
reading experiments, in precisely the
same manner as the first set, and,
for the first part of the experiment,
our figures were substantially the
same. But&mdash;" He stopped.</p>

<p>"Yes?" Malone said, shifting his
feet and trying to take some weight
off his left foot by standing on his
right leg. Then he stood on his left
leg. It didn't seem to do any good.</p>

<p>"I should explain," Dr. O'Connor
said, "that we were conducting
this series with a new set of test subjects:
some of the scientists here at
Yucca Flats. We wanted to see if the
intelligence quotients of the subjects
affected the time of contact which
Charlie was able to maintain. Naturally,
we picked the men here with
the highest IQ's, the two men we
have who are in the top echelon of
the creative genius class." He cleared
his throat. "I did not include myself,
of course, since I wished to remain
an impartial observer, as much
as possible."</p>

<p>"Of course," Malone said without
surprise.</p>

<p>"The other two geniuses," Dr.
O'Connor said, "happen to be connected
with the project known as
Project Isle&mdash;an operation whose
function I neither know, nor care to
know, anything at all about."</p>

<p>Malone nodded. Project Isle was
the non-rocket spaceship. Classified.
Top Secret. Ultra-Secret. And, he
thought, just about anything else you
could think of.</p>

<p>"At first," Dr. O'Connor was saying,
"our detector recorded the time
periods of ... ah mental invasion
as being the same as before. Then,
one day, anomalies began to appear.
The detector showed that the minds
of our subjects were being held for
as long as two or three minutes. But
the phrases repeated by Charlie during
these periods showed that his
own contact time remained the
same; that is, they fell within the
same skewed bell curve as before,
and the mode remained constant if
nothing but the phrase length were
recorded."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m," Malone said, feeling
that he ought to be saying something.</p>

<p>Dr. O'Connor didn't notice him.
"At first we thought of errors in the
detector machine," he went on. "That
worried us not somewhat, since our
understanding of the detector is definitely
limited at this time. We do
feel that it would be possible to replace
some of the electronic components
with appropriate symbolization
like that already used in the
purely psionic sections, but we have,
as yet, been unable to determine exactly
which electronic components
must be replaced by what symbolic
components."</p>

<p>Malone nodded, silently this time.
He had the sudden feeling that Dr.
O'Connor's flow of words had broken
itself up into a vast sea of alphabet
soup, and that he, Malone, was
occupied in drowning in it.</p>

<p>"However," Dr. O'Connor said,
breaking what was left of Malone's
train of thought, "young Charlie
died soon thereafter, and we decided
to go on checking the machine. It
was during this period that we found
someone else reading the minds of
our test subjects&mdash;sometimes for a
few seconds, sometimes for several
minutes."</p>

<p>"Aha," Malone said. Things were
beginning to make sense again.
<i>Someone else.</i> That, of course, was
the spy.</p>

<p>"I found," Dr. O'Connor said,
"on interrogating the subjects more
closely, that they were, in effect,
thinking on two levels. They were
reading the book mechanically, noting
the words and sense, but simply
shuttling the material directly into
their memories without actually
thinking about it. The actual thinking
portions of their minds were
concentrating on aspects of Project
Isle."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"In other words," Malone said,
"someone was spying on them for
information about Project Isle?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," Dr. O'Connor said
with a frosty, teacher-to-student
smile. "And whoever it was had a
much higher concentration time than
Charlie had ever attained. He seems
to be able to retain contact as long
as he can find useful information
flowing in the mind being read."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Malone said.
"Wait a minute. If this spy is so
clever, how come he didn't read
<i>your</i> mind?"</p>

<p>"It is very likely that he has,"
O'Connor said. "What does that
have to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Well," Malone said, "if he
knows you and your group are working
on telepathy and can detect what
he's doing, why didn't he just hold
off on the minds of those geniuses
when they were being tested in your
machine?"</p>

<p>Dr. O'Connor frowned. "I'm
afraid that I can't be sure," he said,
and it was clear from his tone that,
if Dr. Thomas O'Connor wasn't
sure, no one in the entire world was,
had been, or ever would be. "I do
have a theory, however," he said,
brightening up a trifle.</p>

<p>Malone waited patiently.</p>

<p>"He must know our limitations,"
Dr. O'Connor said at last. "He must
be perfectly well aware that there's
not a single thing we can <i>do</i> about
him. He must know that we can neither
find nor stop him. Why should
he worry? He can afford to ignore
us&mdash;or even bait us. We're helpless,
and he knows it."</p>

<p>That, Malone thought, was about
the most cheerless thought he had
heard in some time.</p>

<p>"You mentioned that you had an
insulated room," the FBI agent said
after a while. "Couldn't you let your
men think in there?"</p>

<p>Dr. O'Connor sighed. "The room
is shielded against magnetic fields
and electromagnetic radiation. It is
perfectly transparent to psionic
phenomena, just as it is to gravitational
fields."</p>

<p>"Oh," Malone said. He realized
rapidly that his question had been a
little silly to begin with, since the
insulated room had been the place
where all the tests had been conducted
in the first place. "I don't want
to take up too much of your time,
doctor," he said after a pause, "but
there are a couple of other questions."</p>

<p>"Go right ahead," Dr. O'Connor
said. "I'm sure I'll be able to help
you."</p>

<p>Malone thought of mentioning
how little help the doctor had been
to date, but decided against it. Why
antagonize a perfectly good scientist
without any reason? Instead, he selected
his first question, and asked it.
"Have you got any idea how we
might lay our hands on another telepath?
Preferably one that's not an
imbecile, of course."</p>

<p>Dr. O Connor's expression changed
from patient wisdom to irritation.
"I wish we could, Mr. Malone. I
wish we could. We certainly need
one here to help us with our work&mdash;and
I'm sure that <i>your</i> work is important,
too. But I'm afraid we have
no ideas at all about finding another
telepath. Finding little Charlie was
purely fortuitous&mdash;purely, Mr. Malone,
fortuitous."</p>

<p>"Ah," Malone said. "Sure. Of
course." He thought rapidly and discovered
that he couldn't come up
with one more question. As a matter
of fact, he'd asked a couple of
questions already, and he could barely
remember the answers. "Well," he
said, "I guess that's about it, then,
doctor. If you come across anything
else, be sure and let me
know."</p>

<p>He leaned across the desk, extending
a hand. "And thanks for your
time," he added.</p>

<p>Dr. O'Connor stood up and shook
his hand. "No trouble, I assure you,"
he said. "And I'll certainly give you
all the information I can."</p>

<p>Malone turned and walked out.
Surprisingly, he discovered that his
feet and legs still worked. He had
thought they'd turned to stone in the
office long before.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was on the plane back to Washington
that Malone got his first inkling
of an idea.</p>

<p>The only telepath that the Westinghouse
boys had been able to turn
up was Charles O'Neill, the youthful
imbecile.</p>

<p>All right, then. Suppose there
were another one like him. Imbeciles
weren't very difficult to locate. Most
of them would be in institutions,
and the others would certainly be on
record. It might be possible to find
someone, anyway, who could be handled
and used as a tool to find a telepathic spy.</p>

<p>And&mdash;happy thought!&mdash;maybe
one of them would turn out to be a
high-grade imbecile, or even a
moron.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 449px;">
<img src="images/004.png" width="449" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Even if they only turned up another
imbecile, he thought wearily,
at least Dr. O'Connor would have
something to work with.</p>

<p>He reported back to Burris when
he arrived in Washington, told him
about the interview with Dr. O'Connor,
and explained what had come
to seem a rather feeble brainstorm.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem too productive,"
Burris said, with a shade of disappointment
in his voice, "but we'll
try it."</p>

<p>At that, it was a better verdict than
Malone had hoped for. He had nothing
to do but wait, while orders went
out to field agents all over the United
States, and quietly, but efficiently, the
FBI went to work. Agents probed
and pried and poked their noses into
the files and data sheets of every
mental institution in the fifty states&mdash;as
far, at any rate, as they were
able.</p>

<p>It was not an easy job. The inalienable
right of a physician to
refuse to disclose confidences respecting
a patient applied even to idiots,
imbeciles, and morons. Not even the
FBI could open the private files of
a licensed and registered psychiatrist.</p>

<p>But the field agents did the best
they could and, considering the circumstances,
their best was pretty
good.</p>

<p>Malone, meanwhile, put in two
weeks sitting glumly at his Washington
desk and checking reports as
they arrived. They were uniformly
depressing. The United States of
America contained more subnormal
minds than Malone cared to think
about. There seemed to be enough
of them to explain the results of any
election you were unhappy over. Unfortunately,
subnormal was all you
could call them. Not one of them
appeared to possess any abnormal
psionic abilities whatever.</p>

<p>There were a couple who were reputed
to be poltergeists&mdash;but in
neither case was there a single shred
of evidence to substantiate the
claim.</p>

<p>At the end of the second week,
Malone was just about convinced
that his idea had been a total washout.
A full fortnight had been spent
on digging up imbeciles, while the
spy at Yucca Flats had been going
right on his merry way, scooping information
out of the men at Project
Isle as though he were scooping
beans out of a pot. And, very likely,
laughing himself silly at the feeble
efforts of the FBI.</p>

<p>Who could he be?</p>

<p><i>Anyone</i>, Malone told himself unhappily.
<i>Anyone at all.</i> He could be
the janitor that swept out the buildings,
one of the guards at the gate,
one of the minor technicians on another
project, or even some old
prospector wandering around the
desert with a scintillation counter.</p>

<p>Is there any limit to telepathic
range?</p>

<p>The spy could even be sitting
quietly in an armchair in the Kremlin,
probing through several thousand
miles of solid earth to peep into
the brains of the men on Project
Isle.</p>

<p>That was, to say the very least, a
depressing idea.</p>

<p>Malone found he had to assume
that the spy was in the United States&mdash;that,
in other words, there was
some effective range to telepathic
communication. Otherwise, there
was no point in bothering to continue
the search.</p>

<p>Therefore, he found one other
thing to do. He alerted every agent
to the job of discovering how the
spy was getting his information out
of the country.</p>

<p>He doubted that it would turn up
anything, but it was a chance. And
Malone hoped desperately for it, because
he was beginning to be sure
that the field agents were never going
to turn up any telepathic imbeciles.</p>

<p>He was right.</p>

<p>They never did.</p>



<hr class="hrchp" />
<h2>III</h2>


<p>The telephone rang.</p>

<p>Malone rolled over on the couch
and muttered under his breath. Was
it absolutely necessary for someone
to call him at seven in the morning?</p>

<p>He grabbed at the receiver with
one hand, and picked up his cigar
from the ashtray with the other. It
was bad enough to be awakened
from a sound sleep&mdash;but when a man
hadn't been sleeping at all, it was
even worse.</p>

<p>He'd been sitting up since before
five that morning, worrying about
the telepathic spy, and at the moment
he wanted sleep more than he
wanted phone calls.</p>

<p>"Gur?" he said, sleepily and angrily,
thankful that he'd never had
a visiphone installed in his apartment.</p>

<p>A feminine voice said: "Mr. Kenneth
J. Malone?"</p>

<p>"Who's this?" Malone said peevishly,
beginning to discover himself
capable of semirational English
speech.</p>

<p>"Long distance from San Francisco,"
the voice said.</p>

<p>"It certainly is," Malone said.
"Who's calling?"</p>

<p>"San Francisco is calling," the
voice said primly.</p>

<p>Malone repressed a desire to tell
the voice off, and said instead:
"<i>Who</i> in San Francisco?"</p>

<p>There was a momentary hiatus,
and then the voice said: "Mr. Thomas
Boyd is calling, sir. He says this
is a scramble call."</p>

<p>Malone took a drag from his
cigar and closed his eyes. Obviously
the call was a scramble. If it had
been clear, the man would have
dialed direct, instead of going
through what Malone now recognized
as an operator.</p>

<p>"Mr. Boyd says he is the Agent-in-Charge
of the San Francisco office
of the FBI," the voice offered.</p>

<p>"And quite right, too," Malone
told her. "All right. Put him on."</p>

<p>"One moment." There was a
pause, a click, another pause and
then another click. At last the operator
said: "Your party is ready, sir."</p>

<p>Then there was still another pause.
Malone stared at the audio receiver.
He began to whistle "When Irish
Eyes Are Smiling."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Hello? Malone?"</p>

<p>"I'm here, Tom," Malone said
guiltily. "This is me. What's the
trouble?"</p>

<p>"Trouble?" Boyd said. "There
isn't any trouble. Well, not really.
Or maybe it is. I don't know."</p>

<p>Malone scowled at the audio receiver,
and for the first time wished
he had gone ahead and had a video
circuit put in, so that Boyd could see
the horrendous expression on his
face.</p>

<p>"Look," he said. "It's seven here
and that's too early. Out there, it's
four, and that's practically ridiculous.
What's so important?"</p>

<p>He knew perfectly well that Boyd
wasn't calling him just for the fun
of it. The man was a good agent.
But why a call at this hour?</p>

<p>Malone muttered under his
breath. Then, self-consciously, he
squashed out his cigar and lit a cigarette
while Boyd was saying: "Ken,
I think we may have found what
you've been looking for."</p>

<p>It wasn't safe to say too much,
even over a scrambled circuit. But
Malone got the message without difficulty.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" he said, sitting up on
the edge of the couch. "You sure?"</p>

<p>"Well," Boyd said, "no. Not absolutely
sure. Not absolutely. But it
is worth your taking a personal look,
I think."</p>

<p>"Ah," Malone said cautiously.
"An imbecile?"</p>

<p>"No," Boyd said flatly. "Not an
imbecile. Definitely not an imbecile.
As a matter of fact, a hell of a fat
long way from an imbecile."</p>

<p>Malone glanced at his watch and
skimmed over the airline timetables
in his mind. "I'll be there nine
o'clock, your time," he said. "Have
a car waiting for me at the
field."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As usual, Malone managed to
sleep better on the plane than he'd
been able to do at home. He slept so
well, in fact, that he was still groggy
when he stepped into the waiting
car.</p>

<p>"Good to see you, Ken," Boyd
said briskly, as he shook Malone's
hand.</p>

<p>"You, too, Tom," Malone said
sleepily. "Now what's all this
about?" He looked around apprehensively.
"No bugs in this car, I
hope?" he said.</p>

<p>Boyd gunned the motor and headed
toward the San Francisco Freeway.
"Better not be," he said, "or
I'll fire me a technician or two."</p>

<p>"Well, then," Malone said, relaxing
against the upholstery, "where
is this guy, and who is he? And how
did you find him?"</p>

<p>Boyd looked uncomfortable. It
was, somehow, both an awe-inspiring
and a slightly risible sight. Six
feet one and one half inches tall in
his flat feet, Boyd ported around
over two hundred and twenty pounds
of bone, flesh and muscle. He swung
a potbelly of startling proportions
under the silk shirting he wore, and
his face, with its wide nose, small
eyes and high forehead, was half
highly mature, half startlingly childlike.
In an apparent effort to erase
those childlike qualities, Boyd sported
a fringe of beard and a mustache
which reminded Malone of somebody
he couldn't quite place.</p>

<p>But whoever the somebody was,
his hair hadn't been black, as
Boyd's was&mdash;</p>

<p>He decided it didn't make any difference.
Anyhow, Boyd was speaking.</p>

<p>"In the first place," he said, "it
isn't a guy. In the second, I'm not
exactly sure who it is. And in the
third, Ken, I didn't find it."</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me," Malone said.
"It's a telepathic horse, isn't it? Tom,
I just don't think I could stand a
telepathic horse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," Boyd said hastily. "No.
Not at all. No horse. It's a dame. I
mean a lady." He looked away from
the road and flashed a glance at Malone.
His eyes seemed to be pleading
for something&mdash;understanding, possibly,
Malone thought. "Frankly,"
Boyd said, "I'd rather not tell you
anything about her just yet. I'd rather
you met her first. Then you could
make up your own mind. All right?"</p>

<p>"All right," Malone said wearily.
"Do it your own way. How far do
we have to go?"</p>

<p>"Just about an hour's drive,"
Boyd said. "That's all."</p>

<p>Malone slumped back in the seat
and pushed his hat over his eyes.
"Fine," he said. "Suppose you wake
me up when we get there."</p>

<p>But, groggy as he was, he couldn't
sleep. He wished he'd had some coffee
on the plane. Maybe it would
have made him feel better.</p>

<p>Then again, coffee was only coffee.
True, he had never acquired his
father's taste for gin, but there was
always bourbon.</p>

<p>He thought about bourbon for a
few minutes. It was a nice thought.
It warmed him and made him feel a
lot better. After a while, he even felt
awake enough to do some talking.</p>

<p>He pushed his hat back and struggled
to a reasonable sitting position.
"I don't suppose you have a drink
hidden away in the car somewhere?"
he said tentatively. "Or would the
technicians have found that, too?"</p>

<p>"Better not have," Boyd said in
the same tone as before, "or I'll fire
a couple of technicians." He grinned
without turning. "It's in the door
compartment, next to the forty-five
cartridges and the Tommy gun."</p>

<p>Malone opened the compartment
in the thick door of the car and extracted
a bottle. It was brandy instead
of the bourbon he had been
thinking about, but he discovered
that he didn't mind at all. It went
down as smoothly as milk.</p>

<p>Boyd glanced at it momentarily as
Malone screwed the top back on.</p>

<p>"No," Malone said in answer to
the unspoken question. "You're
driving." Then he settled back again
and tipped his hat forward.</p>

<p>He didn't sleep a wink. He was
perfectly sure of that. But it wasn't
over two seconds later that Boyd
said: "We're here, Ken. Wake up."</p>

<p>"Whadyamean, wakeup," Malone
said. "I wasn't asleep." He thumbed
his hat back and sat up rapidly.
"Where's 'here'?"</p>

<p>"Bayview Neuropsychiatric Hospital,"
Boyd said. "This is where Dr.
Harman works, you know."</p>

<p>"No," Malone said. "As a matter
of fact, I don't know. You didn't tell
me&mdash;remember? And who is Dr.
Harman, anyhow?"</p>

<p>The car was moving up a long,
curving driveway toward a large,
lawn-surrounded building. Boyd
spoke without looking away from the
road.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "this Dr. Willard
Harman is the man who phoned us
yesterday. One of my field agents
was out here asking around about
imbeciles and so on. Found nothing,
by the way. And then this Dr. Harman
called, later. Said he had someone
here I might be interested in. So
I came on out myself for a look, yesterday
afternoon ... after all, we
had instructions to follow up every
possible lead."</p>

<p>"I know," Malone said. "I wrote
them."</p>

<p>"Oh," Boyd said. "Sure. Well,
anyhow, I talked to this dame.
Lady."</p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"And I talked to her," Boyd said.
"I'm not entirely sure of anything
myself. But ... well, hell. You take
a look at her."</p>

<p>He pulled the car up to a parking
space, slid nonchalantly into a slot
marked <i>Reserved&mdash;Executive Director
Sutton</i>, and slid out from under
the wheel while Malone got out the
other side.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They marched up the broad steps,
through the doorway and into the
glass-fronted office of the receptionist.</p>

<p>Boyd showed her his little golden
badge, and got an appropriate gasp.
"FBI," he said. "Dr. Harman's expecting
us."</p>

<p>The wait wasn't over fifteen seconds.
Boyd and Malone marched
down the hall and around a couple
of corners, and came to the doctor's
office. The door was opaqued glass
with nothing but a room number
stenciled on it. Without ceremony,
Boyd pushed the door open. Malone
followed him inside.</p>

<p>The office was small but sunny.
Dr. Willard Harman sat behind a
blond-wood desk, a chunky little
man with crew-cut blond hair and
rimless eyeglasses, who looked about
thirty-two and couldn't possibly,
Malone thought, have been anywhere
near that young. On a second look,
Malone noticed a better age indication
in the eyes and forehead, and
revised his first guess upward between
ten and fifteen years.</p>

<p>"Come in, gentlemen," Dr. Harman
boomed. His voice was that
rarity, a really loud high tenor.</p>

<p>"Dr. Harman," Boyd said, "this
is my superior, Mr. Malone. We'd
like to have a talk with Miss Thompson."</p>

<p>"I anticipated that, sir," Dr. Harman
said. "Miss Thompson is in the
next room. Have you explained to
Mr. Malone that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I haven't explained a thing,"
Boyd said quickly, and added in
what was obviously intended to be
a casual tone: "Mr. Malone wants
to get a picture of Miss Thompson
directly&mdash;without any preconceptions."</p>

<p>"I see," Dr. Harman said. "Very
well, gentlemen. Through this door."</p>

<p>He opened the door in the right-hand
wall of the room, and Malone
took one look. It was a long, long
look. Standing framed in the doorway,
dressed in the starched white
of a nurse's uniform, was the most
beautiful blonde he had ever seen.</p>

<p>She had curves. She definitely had
curves. As a matter of fact, Malone
didn't really think he had ever seen
curves before. These were something
new and different and truly three-dimensional.
But it wasn't the
curves, or the long straight lines of
her legs, or the quiet beauty of her
face, that made her so special. After
all, Malone had seen legs and bodies
and faces before.</p>

<p>At least, he thought he had. Off-hand,
he couldn't remember where.
Looking at the girl, Malone was
ready to write brand-new definitions
for every anatomical term. Even a
term like "hands." Malone had
never seen anything especially arousing
in the human hand before&mdash;anyway,
not when the hand was just
lying around, so to speak, attached
to its wrist but not doing anything
in particular. But these hands, long,
slender and tapering, white and cool-looking....</p>

<p>And yet, it wasn't just the sheer
physical beauty of the girl. She had
something else, something more and
something different. (<i>Something
borrowed</i>, Malone thought in a semi-delirious
haze, <i>and something blue</i>.)
Personality? Character? Soul?</p>

<p>Whatever it was, Malone decided,
this girl had it. She had enough of
it to supply the entire human race,
and any others that might exist in
the Universe. Malone smiled at the
girl and she smiled back.</p>

<p>After seeing the smile, Malone
wasn't sure he could still walk evenly.
Somehow, though, he managed
to go over to her and extend his
hand. The notion that a telepath
would turn out to be this mind-searing
Epitome had never crossed his
mind, but now, somehow, it seemed
perfectly fitting and proper.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Thompson,"
he said in what he hoped was
a winning voice.</p>

<p>The smile disappeared. It was like
the sun going out.</p>

<p>The vision appeared to be troubled.
Malone was about to volunteer
his help&mdash;if necessary, for the next
seventy years&mdash;when she spoke.</p>

<p>"I'm not Miss Thompson," she
said.</p>

<p>"This is one of our nurses," Dr.
Harman put in. "Miss Wilson, Mr.
Malone. And Mr. Boyd. Miss
Thompson, gentlemen, is over
there."</p>

<p>Malone turned.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There, in a corner of the room,
an old lady sat. She was a small old
lady, with apple-red cheeks and
twinkling eyes. She held some knitting
in her hands, and she smiled
up at the FBI men as if they were
her grandsons come for tea and
cookies, of a Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>She had snow-white hair that
shone like a crown around her old
head in the lights of the room. Malone
blinked at her. She didn't disappear.</p>

<p>"<i>You're</i> Miss Thompson?" he
said.</p>

<p>She smiled sweetly. "Oh, my, no,"
she said.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Malone
looked at her. Then he looked at the
unbelievably beautiful Miss Wilson.
Then he looked at Dr. Harman. And,
at last, he looked at Boyd.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "I get it.
<i>You're</i> Miss Thompson."</p>

<p>"Now, wait a minute, Malone,"
Boyd began.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute?" Malone said.
"There are four people here, not
counting me. I know I'm not Miss
Thompson. I never was, not even as
a child. And Dr. Harman isn't, and
Miss Wilson isn't, and Whistler's
Great-Grandmother isn't, either. So
you must be. Unless she isn't here.
Or unless she's invisible. Or unless
I'm crazy."</p>

<p>"It isn't <i>you</i>, Malone," Boyd said.</p>

<p>"What isn't me?"</p>

<p>"That's crazy," Boyd said.</p>

<p>"O.K.," Malone said. "I'm not
crazy. Then will somebody please
tell me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The little old lady cleared her
throat. A silence fell. When it was
complete she spoke, and her voice
was as sweet and kindly as anything
Malone had ever heard.</p>

<p>"You may call me Miss Thompson,"
she said. "For the present, at
any rate. They all do here. It's a
pseudonym I have to use."</p>

<p>"A pseudonym?" Malone said.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Malone," Miss
Wilson began.</p>

<p>Malone stopped her. "Don't talk,"
he said. "I have to concentrate and
if you talk I can barely think." He
took off his hat suddenly, and began
twisting the brim in his hands. "You
understand, don't you?"</p>

<p>The trace of a smile appeared
on her face. "I think I do," she said.</p>

<p>"Now," Malone said, "you're Miss
Thompson, but not really, because
you have to use a pseudonym." He
blinked at the little old lady.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "otherwise people
would find out about my little
secret."</p>

<p>"Your little secret," Malone said.</p>

<p>"That's right," the little old lady
said. "I'm immortal, you see."</p>

<p>Malone said: "Oh." Then he kept
quiet for a long time. It didn't seem
to him that anyone in the room was
breathing.</p>

<p>He said: "Oh," again, but it
didn't sound any better than it had
the first time. He tried another
phrase. "You're immortal," he said.</p>

<p>"That's right," the little old lady
agreed sweetly.</p>

<p>There was only one other question
to ask, and Malone set his teeth
grimly and asked it. It came out just
a trifle indistinct, but the little old
lady nodded.</p>

<p>"My real name?" she said. "Elizabeth.
Elizabeth Tudor, of course. I
used to be Queen."</p>

<p>"Of England," Malone said faintly.</p>

<p>"Malone, look&mdash;" Boyd began.</p>

<p>"Let me get it all at once," Malone
told him. "I'm strong. I can
take it." He twisted his hat again
and turned back to the little old lady.</p>

<p>"You're immortal, and you're not
really Miss Thompson, but Queen
Elizabeth I?" he said slowly.</p>

<p>"That's right," she said. "How
clever of you. Of course, after little
Jimmy&mdash;cousin Mary's boy, I mean&mdash;said
I was dead and claimed the
Throne, I decided to change my name
and all. And that's what I did. But
I am Elizabeth Regina." She smiled,
and her eyes twinkled merrily. Malone
stared at her for a long minute.</p>

<p><i>Burris</i>, he thought, <i>is going to
love this</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad," the little old
lady said. "Do you really think he
will? Because I'm sure I'll like your
Mr. Burris, too. All of you FBI men
are so charming. Just like poor, poor
Essex."</p>

<p>Well, Malone told himself, that
was that. He'd found himself a telepath.</p>

<p>And she wasn't an imbecile.</p>

<p>Oh, no. That would have been
simple.</p>

<p>Instead, she was battier than a
cathedral spire.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The long silence was broken by
the voice of Miss Wilson.</p>

<p>"Mr. Malone," she said, "you've
been thinking." She stopped. "I
mean, you've been so quiet."</p>

<p>"I like being quiet," Malone said
patiently. "Besides&mdash;" He stopped
and turned to the little old lady. <i>Can
you really read my mind?</i> he thought
deliberately. After a second he added:
<i>... your majesty?</i></p>

<p>"How sweet of you, Mr. Malone,"
she said. "Nobody's called me that
for centuries. But of course I can.
Although it's not reading, really.
After all, that would be like asking
if I can read your voice. Of course
I can, Mr. Malone."</p>

<p>"That does it," Malone said. "I'm
not a hard man to convince. And
when I see the truth, I'm the first
one to admit it, even if it makes me
look like a nut." He turned back to
the little old lady. "Begging your
pardon," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, my," the little old lady said.
"I really don't mind at all. Sticks
and stones, you know, can break my
bones. But being called nuts, Mr.
Malone, can never hurt me. After
all, it's been so many years&mdash;so many
hundreds of years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure," Malone said easily.</p>

<p>Boyd broke in. "Listen, Malone,"
he said, "do you mind telling me
what is going on?"</p>

<p>"It's very simple," Malone said.
"Miss Thompson here ... pardon
me; I mean Queen Elizabeth I ...
really is a telepath. That's all. I think
I want to lie down somewhere until
it goes away."</p>

<p>"Until what goes away?" Miss
Wilson said.</p>

<p>Malone stared at her almost without
seeing her, if not quite. "Everything,"
he said. He closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"My goodness," the little old lady
said after a second. "Everything's so
confused. Poor Mr. Malone is terribly
shaken up by everything." She
stood up, still holding her knitting,
and went across the room. Before
the astonished eyes of the doctor and
nurse, and Tom Boyd, she patted the
FBI agent on the shoulder. "There,
there, Mr. Malone," she said. "It
will all be perfectly all right. You'll
see." Then she returned to her seat.</p>

<p>Malone opened his eyes. He turned
to Dr. Harman. "You called up Boyd
here," he said, "and told him that
... er ... Miss Thompson was a
telepath. Howd' you know?"</p>

<p>"It's all right," the little old lady
put in from her chair. "I don't mind
your calling me Miss Thompson, not
right now, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Malone said faintly.</p>

<p>Dr. Harman was blinking in a
kind of befuddled astonishment.
"You mean she really <i>is</i> a&mdash;" He
stopped and brought his tenor voice
to a squeaking halt, regained his professional
poise, and began again.
"I'd rather not discuss the patient in
her presence, Mr. Malone," he said.
"If you'll just come into my office&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>bosh</i>, Dr. Harman," the little
old lady said primly. "I do wish
you'd give your own Queen credit
for some ability. Goodness knows
you think <i>you're</i> smart enough."</p>

<p>"Now, now, Miss Thompson," he
said in what was obviously his best
Grade A Choice Government Inspected
couchside manner. "Don't...."</p>

<p>"... Upset yourself," she finished
for him. "Now, really, doctor. I
know what you're going to tell
them."</p>

<p>"But Miss Thompson, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You didn't honestly think I <i>was</i>
a telepath," the little old lady said.
"Heavens, we know that. And
you're going to tell them how I used
to say I could read minds ... oh,
years and years ago. And because of
that you thought it might be worth
while to tell the FBI about me&mdash;which
wasn't very kind of you, doctor,
before you knew anything about
why they wanted somebody like
me."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Now, now, Miss Thompson,"
Miss Wilson said, walking across
the room to put an arm around the
little old lady's shoulder. Malone
wished for one brief second that he
were the old little old lady. Maybe
if he were a patient in the hospital
he would get the same treatment.</p>

<p>He wondered if he could possibly
work such a deal.</p>

<p>Then he wondered if it would be
worth while, being nuts. But of
course it would. He was nuts anyhow,
wasn't he?</p>

<p>Sure, he told himself. They were
all nuts.</p>

<p>"Nobody's going to hurt you,"
Miss Wilson said. She was talking to
the old lady. "You'll be perfectly all
right and you don't have to worry
about a thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, dear, I know that," the
little old lady said. "You only want
to help me, dear. You're so kind.
And these FBI men really don't
mean any harm. But Dr. Harman
didn't know that. He just thinks I'm
crazy and that's all."</p>

<p>"Please, Miss Thompson&mdash;" Dr.
Harman began.</p>

<p>"Just crazy, that's all," the little
old lady said. She turned away for a
second and nobody said anything.
Then she turned back. "Do you all
know what he's thinking now?" she
said. Dr. Harman turned a dull purple,
but she ignored him. "He's
wondering why I didn't take the
trouble to prove all this to you years
ago. And besides that, he's thinking
about&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 161px;">
<img src="images/005.png" width="161" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Miss Thompson," Dr. Harman
said. His bedside manner had cracked
through and his voice was harsh
and strained. "Please."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," she said, a little
petulantly. "If you want to keep all
that private."</p>

<p>Malone broke in suddenly, fascinated.
"Why didn't you prove you
were telepathic before now?" he
said.</p>

<p>The little old lady smiled at him.
"Why, because you wouldn't have
believed me," she said. She dropped
her knitting neatly in her lap and
folded her hands over it. "None of
you <i>wanted</i> to believe me," she said,
and sniffed. Miss Wilson moved
nervously and she looked up. "And
don't tell me it's going to be all
right. I know it's going to be all
right. I'm going to make sure of
that."</p>

<p>Malone felt a sudden chill. But it
was obvious, he told himself, that the
little old lady didn't mean what she
was saying. She smiled at him again,
and her smile was as sweet and guileless
as the smile on the face of his
very own sainted grandmother.</p>

<p>Not that Malone remembered his
grandmother; she had died before
he'd been born. But if he'd had a
grandmother, and if he'd remembered
her, he was sure she would have
had the same sweet smile.</p>

<p>So she couldn't have meant what
she'd said. Would Malone's own
grandmother make things difficult
for him? The very idea was ridiculous.</p>

<p>Dr. Harman opened his mouth,
apparently changed his mind, and
shut it again. The little old lady
turned to him.</p>

<p>"Were you going to ask why I
bothered to prove anything to Mr.
Malone?" she said. "Of course you
were, and I shall tell you. It's because
Mr. Malone <i>wanted</i> to believe
me. He <i>wants</i> me. He <i>needs</i> me. I'm
a telepath, and that's enough for Mr.
Malone. Isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Gur," Malone said, taken by surprise.
After a second he added: "I
guess so."</p>

<p>"You see, doctor?" the little old
lady said.</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;" Dr. Harman began.</p>

<p>"I read minds," the little old lady
said. "That's right, doctor. That's
what makes me a telepath."</p>

<p>Malone's brain was whirling rapidly,
like a distant galaxy. "Telepath"
was a nice word, he thought.
How did you telepath from a road?</p>

<p>Simple.</p>

<p>A road is paved.</p>

<p>Malone thought that was pretty
funny, but he didn't laugh. He
thought he would never laugh again.
He wanted to cry, a little, but he
didn't think he'd be able to manage
that either.</p>

<p>He twisted his hat, but it didn't
make him feel any better. Gradually,
he became aware that the little old
lady was talking to Dr. Harman
again.</p>

<p>"But," she said, "since it will make
you feel so much better, doctor, we
give you our Royal permission to
retire, and to speak to Mr. Malone
alone."</p>

<p>"Malone alone," Dr. Harman
muttered. "Hm-m-m. My. Well." He
turned and seemed to be surprised
that Malone was actually standing
near him. "Yes," he said. "Well.
Mr. Alone ... Malone ... please,
whoever you are, just come into my
office, please?"</p>

<p>Malone looked at the little old
lady. One of her eyes closed and
opened. It was an unmistakable
wink.</p>

<p>Malone grinned at her in what he
hoped was a cheerful manner. "All
right," he said to the psychiatrist,
"let's go." He turned with the barest
trace of regret, and Boyd followed
him. Leaving the little old lady and,
unfortunately, the startling Miss
Wilson, behind, the procession filed
back into Dr. Harman's office.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The doctor closed the door, and
leaned against it for a second. He
looked as though someone had suddenly
revealed to him that the world
was square. But when he spoke his
voice was almost even.</p>

<p>"Sit down, gentlemen," he said,
and indicated chairs. "I really ...
well, I don't know what to say. All
this time, all these years, she's been
reading my mind! My mind. She's
been reading ... looking right into
my mind, or whatever it is."</p>

<p>"Whatever what is?" Malone asked,
sincerely interested. He had
dropped gratefully into a chair near
Boyd's, across the desk from Dr.
Harman.</p>

<p>"Whatever my <i>mind</i> is," Dr. Harman
said. "Reading it. Oh, my."</p>

<p>"Dr. Harman," Malone began,
but the psychiatrist gave him a
bright blank stare.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand?" he said.
"She's a telepath."</p>

<p>"We&mdash;"</p>

<p>The phone on Dr. Harman's desk
chimed gently. He glanced at it and
said: "Excuse me. The phone." He
picked up the receiver and said:
"Hello?"</p>

<p>There was no image on the
screen.</p>

<p>But the voice was image enough.
"This is Andrew J. Burris," it said.
"Is Kenneth J. Malone there?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Malone?" the psychiatrist
said. "I mean, Mr. Burris? Mr. Malone
is here. Yes. Oh, my. Do you
want to talk to him?"</p>

<p>"No, you idiot," the voice said.
"I just want to know if he's all tucked
in."</p>

<p>"Tucked in?" Dr. Harman gave
the phone a sudden smile. "A joke,"
he said. "It <i>is</i> a joke, isn't it? The
way things have been happening,
you never know whether&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A joke," Burris' voice said.
"That's right. Yes. Am I talking to
one of the patients?"</p>

<p>Dr. Harman gulped, got mad, and
thought better of it. At last he said,
very gently: "I'm not at all sure,"
and handed the phone to Malone.</p>

<p>The FBI agent said: "Hello, chief.
Things are a little confused."</p>

<p>Burris' face appeared on the
screen. "Confused, sure," he said. "I
feel confused already." He took a
breath. "I called the San Francisco
office, and they told me you and
Boyd were out there. What's going
on?"</p>

<p>Malone said cautiously: "We've
found a telepath."</p>

<p>Burris' eyes widened slightly. "Another
one?"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about,
another one?" Malone said. "We
have one. Does anybody else have
any more?"</p>

<p>"Well," Burris said, "we just got
a report on another one&mdash;maybe.
Besides yours, I mean."</p>

<p>"I hope the one you've got is in
better shape than the one I've got,"
Malone said. He took a deep breath,
and then spat it all out at once: "The
one we've found is a little old lady.
She thinks she's Queen Elizabeth I.
She's a telepath, sure, but she's
nuts."</p>

<p>"Queen Elizabeth?" Burris said.
"Of England?"</p>

<p>"That's right," Malone said. He
held his breath.</p>

<p>"Damn it," Burris exploded,
"they've already got one."</p>

<p>Malone sighed. "This is another
one," he said. "Or, rather, the original
one. She also claims she's immortal."</p>

<p>"Lives forever?" Burris said.
"You mean like that?"</p>

<p>"Immortal," Malone said. "Right."</p>

<p>Burris nodded. Then he looked
worried. "Tell me, Malone," he
said. "She <i>isn't</i>, is she?"</p>

<p>"Isn't immortal, you mean?" Malone
said. Burris nodded. Malone
said confidently: "Of course not."</p>

<p>There was a little pause. Malone
thought things over.</p>

<p>Hell, maybe she was immortal.
Stranger things had happened, hadn't
they?</p>

<p>He looked over at Dr. Harman.
"How about that?" he said. "Could
she be immortal?"</p>

<p>The psychiatrist shook his head decisively.
"She's been here for over
forty years, Mr. Malone, ever since
her late teens. Her records show all
that, and her birth certificate is in
perfect order. Not a chance."</p>

<p>Malone sighed and turned back to
the phone. "Of course she isn't immortal,
chief," he said. "She couldn't
be. Nobody is. Just a nut."</p>

<p>"I was afraid of that," Burris said.</p>

<p>"Afraid?" Malone said.</p>

<p>Burris nodded. "We've got another
one&mdash;if he checks out," he said.
"Right here in Washington&mdash;St.
Elizabeths."</p>

<p>"Another nut?"</p>

<p>"Strait-jacket case," Burris said.
"Delusions of persecution. Paranoia.
And a lot of other things I can't
pronounce. But I'm sending him on
out to Yucca Flats anyhow, under
guard. You might find a use for
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure," Malone said.</p>

<p>"We can't afford to overlook a
thing," Burris said.</p>

<p>Malone sighed. "I know," he
said. "But all the same&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about a thing, Malone,"
Burris said with a palpably
false air of confidence. "You get
this Queen Elizabeth of yours out of
there and take her to Yucca Flats,
too."</p>

<p>Malone considered the possibilities.
Maybe they would find more
telepaths. Maybe all the telepaths
would be nuts. It didn't seem unlikely.
Imagine having a talent that
nobody would believe you had. It
might very easily drive you crazy
to be faced with a situation like
that.</p>

<p>And there they would be in Yucca
Flats. Kenneth J. Malone, and a convention
of looney-bin inhabitants.</p>

<p>Fun!</p>

<p>Malone began to wonder why he
had gone into FBI work in the first
place.</p>

<p>"Listen, chief," he said. "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure, I understand," Burris said
quickly. "She's batty. But what else
can we do? Malone, don't do anything
you'll regret."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I mean, don't resign."</p>

<p>"Chief, how did you know&mdash;you're
not telepathic too, are you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," Burris said. "But
that's what I would do in your place.
And don't do it."</p>

<p>"Look, chief," Malone said.
"These nuts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Malone, you've done a wonderful
job so far," Burris said. "You'll
get a raise and a better job when all
this is over. Who else would have
thought of looking in the twitch-bins
for telepaths? But you did, Malone,
and I'm proud of you, and
you're stuck with it. We've got to
use them now. We have to find that
spy!" He took a breath. "On to
Yucca Flats!" he said.</p>

<p>Malone gave up. "Yes, sir," he
said. "Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Not right now," Burris said. "If
there is, I'll let you know."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Malone hung up unhappily as the
image vanished. He looked at Dr.
Harman. "Well," he said, "that's
that. What do I have to do to get a
release for Miss Thompson?"</p>

<p>Harman stared at him. "But, Mr.
Malone," he said, "that just isn't
possible. Really. Miss Thompson is
a ward of the state, and we couldn't
possibly allow her release without a
court order."</p>

<p>Malone thought that over. "O.K.,"
he said at last. "I can see that." He
turned to Boyd. "Here's a job for
you, Tom," he said. "Get one of the
judges on the phone. You'll know
which one will do us the most good,
fastest."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m," Boyd said. "Say
Judge Dunning," he said. "Good
man. Fast worker."</p>

<p>"I don't care who," Malone said.
"Just get going, and get us a release
for Miss Thompson." He turned
back to the doctor. "By the way,"
he said, "has she got any other
name? Besides Elizabeth Tudor, I
mean," he added hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Her full name," Dr. Harman
said, "is Rose Walker Thompson.
She is not Queen Elizabeth I, II, or
XXVIII, and she is not immortal."</p>

<p>"But she is," Malone pointed out,
"a telepath. And that's why I want
her."</p>

<p>"She may," Dr. Harman said, "be
a telepath." It was obvious that he
had partly managed to forget the
disturbing incidents that had happened
a few minutes before. "I don't
even want to discuss that part of it."</p>

<p>"O.K., never mind it," Malone
said agreeably. "Tom, get us a court
order for Rose Walker Thompson.
Effective yesterday&mdash;day before, if
possible."</p>

<p>Boyd nodded, but before he could
get to the phone Dr. Harman spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Now, wait a moment, gentlemen,"
he said. "Court order or no
court order, Miss Thompson is definitely
not a well woman, and I can't
see my way clear to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not well myself," Malone
said. "I need sleep and I probably
have a cold. But I've got to work
for the national security, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is important," Boyd put in.</p>

<p>"I don't dispute that," Dr. Harman
said. "Nevertheless, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door that led into the other
room suddenly burst open. The three
men turned to stare at Miss Wilson,
who stood in the doorway for a long
second and then stepped into the office,
closing the door quietly behind
her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to interrupt," she said.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Malone said. "It's a
pleasure to have you. Come again
soon." He smiled at her.</p>

<p>She didn't smile back. "Doctor,"
she said, "you better talk to Miss
Thompson. I'm not at all sure what
I can do. It's something new."</p>

<p>"New?" he said. The worry lines
on his face were increasing, but he
spoke softly.</p>

<p>"The poor dear thinks she's going
to get out of the hospital now," Miss
Wilson said. "For some reason, she's
convinced that the FBI is going to
get her released, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>As she saw the expressions on
three faces, she stopped.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" she said.</p>

<p>"Miss Wilson," Malone said, "we
... may I call you by your first
name?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Mr. Malone," she
said.</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>"Miss Wilson," Malone said,
"what <i>is</i> your first name?"</p>

<p>She smiled now, very gently. Malone
wanted to walk through mountains,
or climb fire. He felt confused,
but wonderful. "Barbara," she said.</p>

<p>"Lovely," he said. "Well, Barbara
... and please call me Ken. It's
short for Kenneth."</p>

<p>The smile on her face broadened.
"I thought it might be," she said.</p>

<p>"Well," Malone said softly, "it is.
Kenneth. That's my name. And
you're Barbara."</p>

<p>Boyd cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Ah," Malone said. "Yes. Of
course. Well, Barbara ... well,
that's just what we intend to do.
Take Miss Thompson away. We
need her&mdash;badly."</p>

<p>Dr. Harman had said nothing at
all, and had barely moved. He was
staring at a point on his desk. "She
couldn't possibly have heard us," he
muttered. "That's a soundproof
door. She couldn't have heard us."</p>

<p>"But you can't take Miss Thompson
away," Miss Wilson said.</p>

<p>"We have to, Barbara," Malone
said gently. "Try to understand. It's
for the national security."</p>

<p>"She heard us thinking," Dr. Harman
muttered. "That's what; she
heard us thinking. Behind a soundproof
door. She can see inside their
minds. She can even see inside <i>my</i>
mind."</p>

<p>"She's a sick woman," Barbara
said.</p>

<p>"But you have to understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vital necessity," Boyd put in.
"Absolutely vital."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless&mdash;" Barbara said.</p>

<p>"She can read minds," Dr. Harman
whispered in an awed tone.
"She knows. Everything. She
<i>knows</i>."</p>

<p>"It's out of the question," Barbara
said. "Whether you like it or
not. Miss Thompson is not going to
leave this hospital. Why, what could
she do outside these walls? She
hasn't left in over forty years! And
furthermore, Mr. Malone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kenneth," Malone put in, as the
door opened again. "I mean Ken."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The little old lady put her haloed
head into the room. "Now, now,
Barbara," she said. "Don't you go
spoiling things. Just let these nice
men take me away and everything
will be fine, believe me. Besides, I've
been outside more often than you
imagine."</p>

<p>"Outside?" Barbara said.</p>

<p>"Of course," the little old lady
said. "In other people's minds. Even
yours. I remember that nice young
man ... what was his name?"</p>

<p>"Never mind his name," Barbara
said, flushing furiously.</p>

<p>Malone felt instantly jealous of
every nice young man he had ever
even heard of. <i>He</i> wasn't a nice
young man; he was an FBI agent,
and he liked to drink and smoke
cigars and carouse.</p>

<p>All nice young men, he decided,
should be turned into ugly old men
as soon as possible. That'd fix
them!</p>

<p>He noticed the little old lady
smiling at him, and tried to change
his thoughts rapidly. But the little
old lady said nothing at all.</p>

<p>"At any rate," Barbara said, "I'm
afraid that we just can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dr. Harman cleared his throat imperiously.
It was a most impressive
noise, and everyone turned to look
at him. His face was a little gray,
but he looked, otherwise, like a
rather pudgy, blond, crew-cut Roman
emperor.</p>

<p>"Just a moment," he said with
dignity, "I think you're doing the
United States of America a grave injustice,
Miss Wilson&mdash;and that
you're doing an injustice to Miss
Thompson, too."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she said.</p>

<p>"I think it would be nice for her
to get away from me&mdash;I mean from
here," the psychiatrist said. "Where
did you say you were taking her?"
he asked Malone.</p>

<p>"Yucca Flats," Malone said.</p>

<p>"Ah." The news seemed to please
the psychiatrist. "That's a long distance
from here, isn't it? It's quite
a few hundred miles away. Perhaps
even a few thousand miles away. I
feel sure that will be the best thing
for me ... I mean, of course, for
Miss Thompson. I shall recommend
that the court so order."</p>

<p>"Doctor&mdash;" But even Barbara
saw, Malone could tell, that it was
no good arguing with Dr. Harman.
She tried a last attack. "Doctor,
who's going to take care of her?"</p>

<p>A light the size and shape of
North America burst in Malone's
mind. He almost chortled. But he
managed to keep his voice under control.
"What she needs," he said, "is
a trained psychiatric nurse."</p>

<p>Barbara Wilson gave him a look
that had carloads of U<sub>235</sub> stacked
away in it, but Malone barely minded.
She'd get over it, he told himself.</p>

<p>"Now, wasn't that sweet of you
to think of that," the little old lady
said. Malone looked at her and was
rewarded with another wink.</p>

<p>"I'm certainly glad you thought of
Barbara," the little old lady went on.
"You will go with me won't you,
dear? I'll make you a duchess.
Wouldn't you like to be a duchess,
dear?"</p>

<p>Barbara looked from Malone to
the little old lady, and then she
looked at Dr. Harman. Apparently
what she saw failed to make her
happy.</p>

<p>"We'll take good care of her, Barbara,"
Malone said.</p>

<p>She didn't even bother to give him
an answer. After a second Boyd
said: "Well, I guess that settles it.
If you'll let me use your phone, Dr.
Harman, I'll call Judge Dunning."</p>

<p>"Go right ahead," Dr. Harman
said. "Go right ahead."</p>

<p>The little old lady smiled softly
without looking at anybody at all.
"Won't it be wonderful?" she whispered.
"At last I've been recognized.
My country is about to pay me for
my services. My loyal subjects&mdash;"
She stopped and wiped what Malone
thought was a tear from one cornflower-blue
eye.</p>

<p>"Now, now, Miss Thompson,"
Barbara said.</p>

<p>"I'm not sad," the little old lady
said, smiling up at her. "I'm just so
very happy. I am about to get my
reward, my well-deserved reward at
last, from all of my loyal subjects.
You'll see." She paused and Malone
felt a faint stirring of stark, chill
fear.</p>

<p>"Won't it be wonderful?" said
the little old lady.</p>



<hr class="hrchp" />
<h2>IV</h2>


<p>"You're <i>where</i>?" Andrew J. Burris
said.</p>

<p>Malone looked at the surprised
face on the screen and wished he
hadn't called. He had to report in,
of course&mdash;but, if he'd had any
sense, he'd have ordered Boyd to do
the job for him.</p>

<p>Oh, well, it was too late for that
now. "I'm in Las Vegas," he said. "I
tried to get you last night, but I
couldn't, so I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Las Vegas," Burris said. "Well,
well. Las Vegas." His face darkened
and his voice became very loud.
"Why aren't you in Yucca Flats?"
he screamed.</p>

<p>"Because she insisted on it," Malone
said. "The old lady. Miss
Thompson. She says there's another
telepath here."</p>

<p>Burris closed his eyes. "Well,
that's a relief," he said at last.
"Somebody in one of the gambling
houses, I suppose. Fine, Malone."
He went right on without a pause:
"The boys have uncovered two more
in various parts of the nation. Not
one of them is even close to sane."
He opened his eyes. "Where's this
one?" he said.</p>

<p>Malone sighed. "In the looney
bin," he said.</p>

<p>Burris' eyes closed again. Malone
waited in silence. At last Burris
said: "All right. Get him out."</p>

<p>"Right," Malone said.</p>

<p>"Tell me," Burris said. "Why did
Miss Thompson insist that you go to
Las Vegas? Somebody else could
have done the job. You could have
sent Boyd, couldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Chief," Malone said slowly,
"what sort of mental condition are
those other telepaths in?"</p>

<p>"Pretty bad," Burris said. "As a
matter of fact, very bad. Miss
Thompson may be off her trolley,
but the others haven't even got any
tracks." He paused. "What's that got
to do with it?" he said.</p>

<p>"Well," Malone said, "I figured
we'd better handle Miss Thompson
with kid gloves&mdash;at least until we
find a better telepath to work with."
He didn't mention Barbara Wilson.
The chief, he told himself, didn't
want to be bothered with details.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 325px; margin-bottom: 0;">

<img src="images/006-2.png" style="display: block;" width="155" height="220" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p>"Doggone right you'd better,"
Burris said. "You treat that old lady
as if she were the Queen herself, understand?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry," Malone said unhappily.
"We are." He hesitated.
"She says she'll help us find our spy,
all right, but we've got to do it her
way&mdash;or else she won't co-operate."</p>

<p>"Do it her way, then," Burris
said. "That spy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chief, are you sure?"</p>

<p>Burris blinked. "Well, then," he
said, "what <i>is</i> her way?"</p>

<p>Malone took a deep breath.
"First," he said, "we had to come
here and pick this guy up. This William
Logan, who's in a private sanitarium
just outside of Las Vegas.
That's number one. Miss Thompson
wants to get all the telepaths together,
so they can hold mental conversations
or something."</p>

<p>"And all of them batty," Burris
said.</p>

<p>"Sure," Malone said. "A convention
of nuts&mdash;and me in the middle.
Listen, chief&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Later," Burris said. "When this
is over we can all resign, or go fishing,
or just plain shoot ourselves.
But right now the national security
is primary, Malone. Remember
that."</p>

<p>"O.K.," Malone sighed. "O.K.
But she wants all the nuts here."</p>

<p>"Go along with her," Burris snapped.
"Keep her happy. So far, Malone,
she's the only lead we have on
the guy who's swiping information
from Yucca Flats. If she wants something,
Malone, you do it."</p>

<p>"But, chief&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt me," Burris said.
"If she wants to be treated like a
queen, you treat her like one. Malone,
that's an order!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Malone said sadly.
"But, chief, she wants us to buy her
some new clothes."</p>

<p>Burris exploded: "Is that all? New
clothes? Get 'em. Put 'em on the expense
account. New clothes are a
drop in the bucket."</p>

<p>"Well ... she thinks we need
new clothes, too."</p>

<p>"Maybe you do," Burris said.
"Put the whole thing on the expense
account. You don't think I'm going
to quibble about a few dollars, do
you?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get the clothes. Just don't bother
me with details like this. Handle the
job yourself, Malone&mdash;you're in
charge out there. And get to Yucca
Flats as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Malone gave up. "Yes, sir," he
said.</p>

<p>"All right, then," Burris said.
"Call me tomorrow. Meanwhile&mdash;good
luck, Malone. Chin up."</p>

<p>Malone said: "Yes, sir," and
reached for the switch. But Burris'
voice stopped him.</p>

<p>"Just one thing," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, chief?" Malone said.</p>

<p>Burris frowned. "Don't spend any
more for the clothes than you have
to," he said.</p>

<p>Malone nodded, and cut off.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When the director's image had
vanished, he got up and went to the
window of the hotel room. Outside,
a huge sign told the world, and Malone,
that this was the Thunderbird-Hilton-Zeckendorf
Hotel, but Malone
ignored it. He didn't need a
sign; he knew where he was.</p>

<p>In hot water, he thought. <i>That's</i>
where he was.</p>

<p>Behind him, the door opened. Malone
turned as Boyd came in.</p>

<p>"I found a costume shop, Ken,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Great," Malone said. "The chief
authorized it."</p>

<p>"He did?" Boyd's round face fell
at the news.</p>

<p>"He said to buy her whatever she
wants. He says to treat her like a
queen."</p>

<p>"That," Boyd said, "we're doing
now."</p>

<p>"I know it," Malone said. "I
know it altogether too well."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," Boyd said, brightening,
"the costume shop doesn't do us
any good. They've only got cowboy
stuff and bullfighters' costumes and
Mexican stuff&mdash;you know, for their
Helldorado Week here."</p>

<p>"You didn't give up, did you?"
Malone said.</p>

<p>Boyd shook his head. "Of course
not," he said. "Ken, this is on the
expense account, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Expense account," Malone said.
"Sure it is."</p>

<p>Boyd looked relieved. "Good," he
said. "Because I had the proprietor
phone her size in, to New York."</p>

<p>"Better get two of 'em," Malone
said. "The chief said anything she
wanted, she was supposed to have."</p>

<p>"I'll go back right away. I told
him we wanted the stuff on the afternoon
plane, so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And give him Bar ... Miss Wilson's
size, and yours, and mine. Tell
him to dig up something appropriate."</p>

<p>"For us?" Boyd blanched visibly.</p>

<p>"For us," Malone said grimly.</p>

<p>Boyd set his jaw. "No," he said.</p>

<p>"Listen, Tom," Malone said, "I
don't like this any better than you
do. But if I can't resign, you can't
either. Costumes for everybody."</p>

<p>"But," Boyd said, and stopped.
After a second he went on: "Malone
... Ken ... FBI agents are supposed
to be inconspicuous, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>Malone nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, how inconspicuous are we
going to be in this stuff?"</p>

<p>"It's an idea," Malone said. "But
it isn't a very good one. Our first
job is to keep Miss Thompson happy.
And that means costumes. And
what's more," Malone added, "from
now on she's 'Your Majesty'. Got
that?"</p>

<p>"Ken," Boyd said, "you've gone
nuts."</p>

<p>Malone shook his head. "No, I
haven't," he said. "I just wish I had.
It would be a relief."</p>

<p>"Me, too," Boyd said. He started
for the door and turned. "I wish I
could have stayed in San Francisco,"
he said. "Why should she insist on
taking <i>me</i> along?"</p>

<p>"The beard," Malone said.</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> beard?" Boyd recoiled.</p>

<p>"Right," Malone said. "She says
it reminds her of someone she
knows. Frankly, it reminds me of
someone, too. Only I don't know
who."</p>

<p>Boyd gulped. "I'll shave it off,"
he said, with the air of a man who
can do no more to propitiate the
Gods.</p>

<p>"You will not," Malone said firmly.
"Touch but a hair of yon black
chin, and I'll peel off your entire
skin."</p>

<p>Boyd winced.</p>

<p>"Now," Malone said, "go back to
that costume shop and arrange
things. Here." He fished in his pockets,
came out with a crumpled slip
of paper and handed it to Boyd.
"That's a list of my clothing sizes.
Get another list from B ... Miss
Wilson." Boyd nodded. Malone
thought he detected a strange glint
in the other man's eye. "Don't
measure her yourself," he said. "Just
ask her."</p>

<p>Boyd scratched his bearded chin
and nodded slowly. "All right,
Ken," he said. "But if we just don't
get anywhere, don't blame me."</p>

<p>"If you get anywhere," Malone
said, "I'll snatch you baldheaded.
And I'll leave the beard."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean with Miss Wilson,
Ken," Boyd said. "I meant in general."
He left, with the air of a man
whose world has betrayed him. His
back looked, to Malone, like the back
of a man on his way to the scaffold
or guillotine.</p>

<p>The door closed.</p>

<p>Now, Malone thought, who does
that beard remind me of? Who do
I know who knows Miss Thompson?</p>

<p>And what difference does it make?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he told himself,
Boyd's beard was really an admirable
fact of nature. Ever since
beards had become popular again in
the mid-sixties, and FBI agents had
been permitted to wear them, Malone
had thought about growing one.
But, somehow, it didn't seem right.</p>

<p>Now, looking at Boyd, he began
to think about the prospect again.</p>

<p>He shrugged the notion away.
There were things to do.</p>

<p>He picked up the phone and called
Information.</p>

<p>"Can you give me," he said, "the
number of the Desert Edge Sanitarium?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The crimson blob of the setting
sun was already painting the desert
sky with its customary purples and
oranges by the time the little caravan
arrived at the Desert Edge Sanitarium,
a square white building several
miles out of Las Vegas. Malone, in
the first car, wondered briefly about
the kind of patients they catered to?
People driven mad by vingt-et-un or
poker-dice? Neurotic chorus ponies?
Gambling czars with delusions of
non-persecution?</p>

<p>Sitting in the front seat next to
Boyd, he watched the unhappy San
Francisco agent manipulating the
wheel. In the back seat, Queen Elizabeth
Thompson and Lady Barbara,
the nurse, were located, and Her
Majesty was chattering away like a
magpie.</p>

<p>Malone eyed the rear-view mirror
to get a look at the car following
them and the two local FBI agents
in it. They were, he thought, unbelievably
lucky. He had to sit and listen
to the Royal Personage in the
back seat.</p>

<p>"Of course, as soon as Parliament
convenes and recognizes me," she
was saying, "I shall confer personages
on all of you. Right now, the
best I can do is to knight you all,
and of course that's hardly enough.
But I think I shall make Sir Kenneth
the Duke of Columbia."</p>

<p>Sir Kenneth, Malone realized, was
himself. He wondered how he'd like
being Duke of Columbia&mdash;and
wouldn't the President be surprised!</p>

<p>"And Sir Thomas," the queen
continued, "will be the Duke of ...
what? Sir Thomas?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Majesty?" Boyd said,
trying to sound both eager and
properly respectful.</p>

<p>"What would you like to be Duke
of?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh," Boyd said after a second's
thought, "anything that pleases Your
Majesty." But, apparently, his
thoughts gave him away.</p>

<p>"You're from upstate New
York?" the Queen said. "How very
nice. Then you must be made the
Duke of Poughkeepsie."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Your Majesty," Boyd
said. Malone thought he detected a
note of pride in the man's voice, and
shot a glance at Boyd, but the agent
was driving with a serene face and
an economy of motion.</p>

<p><i>Duke of Poughkeepsie!</i> Malone
thought. <i>Hah!</i></p>

<p>He leaned back and adjusted his
fur-trimmed coat. The plume that
fell from his cap kept tickling his
neck, and he brushed at it without
success.</p>

<p>All four of the inhabitants of the
car were dressed in late Sixteenth
Century costumes, complete with
ruffs and velvet and lace filigree. Her
Majesty and Lady Barbara were
wearing the full skirts and small
skullcaps of the era&mdash;and on Barbara,
Malone thought privately, the
low-cut gowns didn't look at all disappointing&mdash;and
Sir Thomas and
Malone&mdash;Sir Kenneth, he thought
sourly&mdash;were clad in doublet, hose
and long coats with fur trim and
slashed sleeves. And all of them were
loaded down, weighted down, staggeringly,
with gems.</p>

<p>Naturally, the gems were fake.
But then, Malone thought, the
Queen was mad. It all balanced out
in the end.</p>

<p>As they approached the sanitarium,
Malone breathed a thankful
prayer that he'd called up to tell the
head physician how they'd all be
dressed. If he hadn't&mdash;</p>

<p>He didn't want to think about
that.</p>

<p>He didn't even want to pass it by
hurriedly on a dark night.</p>

<p>The head physician, Dr. Frederic
Dowson, was waiting for them on
the steps of the building. He was a
tall, thin, cadaverous-looking man
with almost no hair and very deep-sunken
eyes. He had the kind of
face that a gushing female would
probably describe, Malone thought,
as "craggy," but it didn't look in the
least attractive to Malone. Instead, it
looked tough and forbidding.</p>

<p>He didn't turn a hair as the magnificently
robed Boyd slid from the
front seat, opened the rear door,
doffed his plumed hat, and in one
low sweep made a great bow. "We
are here, Your Majesty," Boyd said.</p>

<p>Her Majesty got out, clutching at
her voluminous skirts in a worried
manner, to keep from catching them
on the door jamb. "You know, Sir
Thomas," she said when she was
standing free of the car, "I think
we must be related."</p>

<p>"Ah?" Boyd said worriedly.</p>

<p>"I'm certain of it, in fact," Her
Majesty went on. "You look just exactly
like my poor father. Just exactly.
I dare say you come from one of
the sinister branches of the family.
Perhaps you are a half-brother of
mine&mdash;removed, of course."</p>

<p>Malone grinned, and tried to hide
the expression. Boyd was looking
puzzled, then distantly angered. Nobody
had ever called him illegitimate
in just that way before.</p>

<p>But Her Majesty was absolutely
right, Malone thought. The agent
had always reminded him of someone,
and now, at last, he knew exactly
who. The hair hadn't been
black, either, but red.</p>

<p>Boyd was, in Elizabethan costume,
the deadest of dead ringers for
Henry VIII.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Malone went up the steps to
where Dr. Dowson was standing.</p>

<p>"I'm Malone," he said, checking
a tendency to bow. "I called earlier
today. Is this William Logan of yours
ready to go? We can take him back
with us in the second car."</p>

<p>Dr. Dowson compressed his lips
and looked worried. "Come in, Mr.
Malone," he said. He turned just as
the second carload of FBI agents
began emptying itself over the hospital
grounds.</p>

<p>The entire procession filed into
the hospital office, the two local
agents bringing up the rear. Since
they were not a part of Her Majesty's
personal retinue, they had not
been required to wear court costumes.
In a way, Malone was beginning
to feel sorry for them. He himself
cut a nice figure in the outfit,
he thought&mdash;rather like Errol Flynn
in the old black-and-white print of
"The Prince and the Pauper."</p>

<p>But there was no denying that the
procession looked strange. File
clerks and receptionists stopped their
work to gape at the four bedizened
walkers and their plainly dressed
satellites. Malone needed no telepathic
talent to tell what they were
thinking.</p>

<p>"A whole roundup of nuts," they
were thinking. "And those two fellows
in the back must be bringing
them in&mdash;along with Dr. Dowson."</p>

<p>Malone straightened his spine.
Really, he didn't see why Elizabethan
costumes had ever gone out of style.
Elizabeth was back, wasn't she&mdash;either
Elizabeth II, on the throne, or
Elizabeth I, right behind him. Either
way you looked at it&mdash;</p>

<p>When they were all inside the
waiting room, Dr. Dowson said:
"Now, Mr. Malone, just what is all
this about?" He rubbed his long
hands together. "I fail to see the
humor of the situation."</p>

<p>"Humor?" Malone said.</p>

<p>"Doctor," Barbara Wilson began,
"let me explain. You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"These ridiculous costumes," Dr.
Dowson said, waving a hand at them.
"You may feel that poking fun at
insanity is humorous, Mr. Malone,
but let me tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It wasn't like that at all," Boyd
said.</p>

<p>"And," Dr. Dowson continued in
a somewhat louder voice, "wanting
to take Mr. Logan away from us. Mr.
Logan is a very sick man, Mr. Malone.
He should be properly cared
for."</p>

<p>"I promise we'll take good care of
him." Malone said earnestly. The
Elizabethan clothes were fine outdoors,
but in a heated room one had
a tendency to sweat.</p>

<p>"I take leave to doubt that," Dr.
Dowson said, eying their costumes
pointedly.</p>

<p>"Miss Wilson here," Malone volunteered,
"is a trained psychiatric
nurse."</p>

<p>Barbara, in her gown, stepped
forward. "Dr. Dowson," she said,
"let me assure you that these costumes
have their purpose. We&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not only that," Malone said.
"There are a group of trained men
from St. Elizabeths Hospital in
Washington who are going to take
the best of care of him." He said
nothing whatever about Yucca Flats,
or about telepathy.</p>

<p>Why spread around information
unnecessarily?</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," Dr.
Dowson said. "What interest could
the FBI have in an insane man?"</p>

<p>"That's none of your business,"
Malone said. He reached inside his
fur-trimmed robe and, again suppressing
a tendency to bow deeply,
withdrew an impressive-looking legal
document. "This," he said, "is a
court order, instructing you to hand
over to us the person of one William
Logan, herein identified and described."
He waved it at the doctor.
"That's your William Logan," he
said, "only now he's ours."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Dr. Dowson took the papers and
put in some time frowning at them.
Then he looked up again at Malone.
"I assume that I have some discretion
in this matter," he said. "And
I wonder if you realize just how ill
Mr. Logan is? We have his case histories
here, and we have worked
with him for some time."</p>

<p>Barbara Wilson said: "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I might say that we are beginning
to understand his illness," Dr. Dowson
said. "I honestly don't think it
would be proper to transfer this work
to another group of therapists. It
might set his illness back&mdash;cause, as
it were, a relapse. All our work
could easily be nullified."</p>

<p>"Please, doctor," Barbara Wilson
began.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the court order's got
to stand," Malone said. Privately, he
felt sorry for Dr. Dowson, who was,
obviously enough, a conscientious
man trying to do the best he could
for his patient. But&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Dr. Dowson," he said.
"We'll expect you to send all of your
data to the government psychiatrists&mdash;and,
naturally, any concern for the
patient's welfare will be our concern
also. The FBI isn't anxious for its
workers to get the reputation of careless
men." He paused, wondering
what other bone he could throw the
man. "I have no doubt that the St.
Elizabeths men will be happy to accept
your co-operation," he said at
last. "But, I'm afraid that our duty
is clear. William Logan goes with
us."</p>

<p>Dr. Dowson looked at them sourly.
"Does he have to get dressed up
like a masquerade, too?" Before Malone
could answer, the psychiatrist
added: "Anyhow, I don't even know
you're FBI men. After all, why
should I comply with orders from a
group of men, dressed insanely,
whom I don't even know?"</p>

<p>Malone didn't say anything. He
just got up and walked to a phone
on a small table, near the wall. Next
to it was a door, and Malone wondered
uncomfortably what was behind it.
Maybe Dr. Dowson had a
small arsenal there, to protect his
patients and prevent people from
pirating them.</p>

<p>He looked back at the set and
dialed Burris' private number in
Washington. When the director's
face appeared on the screen, Malone
said: "Mr. Burris, will you please
identify me to Dr. Dowson?" He
looked over at Dowson. "You recognize
Mr. Andrew J. Burris, I suppose?"
he said.</p>

<p>Dowson nodded. His grim face
showed a faint shock. He walked to
the phone, and Malone stepped back
to let him talk with Burris.</p>

<p>"My name is Dowson," he said.
"I'm psychiatric director here at
Desert Edge Sanitarium. And your
men&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My men have orders to take a
William Logan from your care,"
Burris said.</p>

<p>"That's right," Dowson said.
"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>While they were talking, Queen
Elizabeth I sidled quietly up to Malone
and tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Sir Kenneth," she whispered in
the faintest of voices, "I know where
your telepathic spy is. And I know
<i>who</i> he is."</p>

<p>"Who?" Malone said. "What?
Why? Where?" He blinked and
whirled. It couldn't be true. They
couldn't solve the case so easily.</p>

<p>But the Queen's face was full of
a majestic assurance. "He's right
there," she said, and she pointed.</p>

<p>Malone followed her finger.</p>

<p>It was aimed directly at the glowing
image of Andrew J. Burris, Director
of the FBI.</p>

</div><p><span class="dcap">alone</span> opened his
mouth, but nothing
came out. Not even air.</p>

<p>He wasn't breathing.</p>

<p>He stared at Burris
for a long moment, then took a
breath and looked again at Her Majesty.
"The spy?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"That's right," she said.</p>

<p>"But that's&mdash;" He had to fight for
control. "That's the head of the FBI,"
he managed to say. "Do you mean to
say he's a spy?"</p>

<p>Burris was saying: "... I'm afraid
this is a matter of importance, Dr.
Dowson. We cannot tolerate delay.
You have the court order. Obey it."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Burris," Dowson
said with an obvious lack of grace.
"I'll release him to Mr. Malone immediately,
since you insist."</p>

<p>Malone stared, fascinated. Then he
turned back to the little old lady. "Do
you mean to tell me," he said, "that
Andrew J. Burris is a telepathic spy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me," Her Majesty said,
obviously aghast. "My goodness gracious.
Is that Mr. Burris on the
screen?"</p>

<p>"It is," Malone assured her. A look
out of the corner of his eye told him
that neither Burris, in Washington,
nor Dowson or any others in the
room, had heard any of the conversation.
Malone lowered his whisper
some more, just in case. "That's the
head of the FBI," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, then," Her Majesty said,
"Mr. Burris couldn't possibly be a
spy, then, could he? Not if he's the
head of the FBI. Of course not. Mr.
Burris simply isn't a spy. He isn't the
type. Forget all about Mr. Burris."</p>

<p>"I can't," Malone said at random.
"I work for him." He closed his eyes.
The room, he had discovered, was
spinning slightly. "Now," he said,
"you're sure he's not a spy?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I'm sure," she said, with
her most regal tones. "Do you doubt
the word of your sovereign?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," Malone said. Truthfully,
he wasn't at all sure. Not at all.
But why tell that to the Queen?</p>

<p>"Shame on you," she said. "You
shouldn't even think such things.
After all, I am the Queen, aren't I?"
But there was a sweet, gentle smile
on her face when she spoke; she did
not seem to be really irritated.</p>

<p>"Sure you are," Malone said.
"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Malone!" It was Burris' voice,
from the phone. Malone spun around.
"Take Mr. Logan," Burris said, "and
get going. There's been enough delay
as it is."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Malone said. "Right
away, sir. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"That's all," Burris said. "Good
night." The screen blanked.</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>"All right, doctor," Boyd said. He
looked every inch a king, and Malone
knew exactly what king. "Bring him
out."</p>

<p>Dr. Dowson heaved a great sigh.
"Very well," he said heavily. "But I
want it known that I resent this high-handed
treatment, and I shall write a
letter complaining of it." He pressed
a button on an instrument panel in
his desk. "Bring Mr. Logan in," he
said.</p>

<p>Malone wasn't in the least worried
about the letter. Burris, he knew,
would take care of anything like that.
And, besides, he had other things to
think about.</p>

<p>The door to the next room had
opened almost immediately, and two
husky, white-clad men were bringing
in a strait-jacketed figure whose arms
were wrapped against his chest, while
the jacket's extra-long sleeves were
tied behind his back. He walked
where the attendants led him, but his
eyes weren't looking at anything in
the room. They stared at something
far away and invisible, an impalpable
shifting nothingness somewhere in the
infinite distances beyond the world.</p>

<p>For the first time, Malone felt the
chill of panic. Here, he thought, was
insanity of a very real and frightening
kind. Queen Elizabeth Thompson
was one thing&mdash;and she was almost
funny, and likable, after all. But William
Logan was something else, and
something that sent a wave of cold
shivering into the room.</p>

<p>What made it worse was that Logan
wasn't a man, but a boy, barely nineteen.
Malone had known that, of
course&mdash;but seeing it was something
different. The lanky, awkward figure
wrapped in a hospital strait jacket was
horrible, and the smooth, unconcerned
face was, somehow, worse. There was
no threat in that face, no terror or
anger or fear. It was merely&mdash;a blank.</p>

<p>It was not a human face. Its complete
lack of emotion or expression
could have belonged to a sleeping
child of ten&mdash;or to a member of a
different race. Malone looked at the
boy, and looked away.</p>

<p>Was it possible that Logan knew
what he was thinking?</p>

<p><i>Answer me</i>, he thought, directly at
the still boy.</p>

<p>There was no reply, none at all.
Malone forced himself to look away.
But the air in the room seemed to have
become much colder.</p>

<p>The attendants stood on either side
of him, waiting. For one long second
no one moved, and then Dr. Dowson
reached into his desk drawer and produced
a sheaf of papers.</p>

<p>"If you'll sign these for the government,"
he said, "you may have Mr.
Logan. There seems little else that I
can do, Mr. Malone&mdash;in spite of my
earnest pleas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Malone said. After
all, he <i>needed</i> Logan, didn't he? After
a look at the boy, he wasn't sure any
more&mdash;but the Queen had said she
wanted him, and the Queen's word
was law. Or what passed for law, anyhow,
at least for the moment.</p>

<p>Malone took the papers and looked
them over. There was nothing special
about them; they were merely standard
release forms, absolving the staff
and management of Desert Edge Sanitarium
from every conceivable responsibility
under any conceivable circumstances,
as far as William Logan was
concerned. Dr. Dowson gave Malone
a look that said: "Very well, Mr. Malone;
I will play Pilate and wash my
hands of the matter&mdash;but you needn't
think I like it." It was a lot for one
look to say, but Dr. Dowson's dark
and sunken eyes got the message
across with no loss in transmission.
As a matter of fact, there seemed to
be more coming&mdash;a much less printable
message was apparently on the
way through those glittering, sad and
angry eyes.</p>

<p>Malone avoided them nervously,
and went over the papers again instead.
At last he signed them and
handed them back. "Thanks for your
co-operation, Dr. Dowson," he said
briskly, feeling ten kinds of a traitor.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Dowson said bitterly.
"Mr. Logan is now in your custody.
I must trust you to take good care of
him."</p>

<p>"The best care we can," Malone
said. It didn't seem sufficient. He
added: "The best possible care, doctor,"
and tried to look dependable
and trustworthy, like a Boy Scout. He
was aware that the effort failed miserably.</p>

<p>At his signal, the two plainclothes
FBI men took over from the attendants.
They marched Logan out to their
car, and Malone led the procession
back to Boyd's automobile, a procession
that consisted&mdash;in order&mdash;of Sir
Kenneth Malone, prospective Duke of
Columbia, Queen Elizabeth I, Lady
Barbara, prospective Duchess of an
unspecified county, and Sir Thomas
Boyd, prospective Duke of Poughkeepsie.
Malone hummed a little of
"Pomp and Circumstance" as they
walked; somehow, he thought it was
called for.</p>

<p>They piled into the car, Boyd at
the wheel with Malone next to him,
and the two ladies in back, with
Queen Elizabeth sitting directly behind
Sir Thomas. Boyd started the
engine and they turned and roared
off.</p>

<p>"Well," said Her Majesty with an
air of great complacence, "that's that.
That makes six of us."</p>

<p>Malone looked around the car. He
counted the people. There were four.
He said, puzzled: "Six?"</p>

<p>"That's right, Sir Kenneth," Her
Majesty said. "You have it exactly.
Six."</p>

<p>"You mean six telepaths?" Sir
Thomas asked in a deferent tone of
voice.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do," Her Majesty replied.
"We telepaths, you know, must
stick together. That's the reason I got
poor little Willie out of that sanitarium
of his, you know&mdash;and, of
course, the others will be joining us."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's time for your
nap, dear?" Lady Barbara put in suddenly.</p>

<p>"My <i>what</i>?" It was obvious that
Queen Elizabeth was Not Amused.</p>

<p>"Your nap, dear," Lady Barbara
said.</p>

<p>"Don't call me 'dear,'" Her Majesty
snapped.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Your Majesty," Barbara
murmured. "But really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear girl," Her Majesty said,
"I am not a child. I am your sovereign.
Do try to have a little respect.
Why, I remember when Shakespeare
used to say to me&mdash;but that's no matter,
not now."</p>

<p>"About those telepaths&mdash;" Boyd
began.</p>

<p>"Telepaths," Her Majesty said.
"Ah, yes. We must all stick together.
In the hospital, you know, we had a
little joke&mdash;the patients for Insulin
Shock Therapy used to say: 'If we
don't stick together, we'll all be stuck
separately.' Do you see, Sir Thomas?"</p>

<p>"But," Sir Kenneth Malone said,
trying desperately to return to the
point. "<i>Six?</i>" He had counted them
up in his mind. Burris had mentioned
one found in St. Elizabeths, and two
more picked up later. With Queen
Elizabeth, and now William Logan,
that made five.</p>

<p>Unless the Queen was counting
him in. There didn't seem any good
reason why not.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Her Majesty said with
a little trill of laughter, "not you,
Sir Kenneth. I meant Mr. Miles."</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Boyd asked: "Mr.
Miles?"</p>

<p>"That's right," Her Majesty said.
"His name is Barry Miles, and your
FBI men found him an hour ago in
New Orleans. They're bringing him
to Yucca Flats to meet the rest of us;
isn't that nice?"</p>

<p>Lady Barbara cleared her throat.</p>

<p>"It really isn't necessary for you to
try to get my attention, dear," the
Queen said. "After all, I do know
what you're thinking."</p>

<p>Lady Barbara blinked. "I still want
to suggest, respectfully, about that
nap&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"My dear girl," the Queen said,
with the faintest trace of impatience,
"I do not feel the least bit tired, and
this is such an exciting day that I just
don't want to miss any of it. Besides,
I've already told you I don't want a
nap. It isn't polite to be insistent to
your Queen&mdash;no matter how strongly
you feel about a matter. I'm sure
you'll learn to understand that, dear."</p>

<p>Lady Barbara opened her mouth,
shut it again, and opened it once more.
"My goodness," she said.</p>

<p>"That's the idea," Her Majesty
said approvingly. "Think before you
speak&mdash;and then don't speak. It really
isn't necessary, since I know what
you're thinking."</p>

<p>Malone said grimly: "About this
new telepath ... this Barry Miles. Did
they find him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In a nut-house?" Her Majesty said
sweetly. "Why, of course, Sir Kenneth.
You were quite right when you
thought that telepaths went insane
because they had a sense they couldn't
effectively use, and because no one
believed them. How would you feel,
if nobody believed you could see?"</p>

<p>"Strange," Malone admitted.</p>

<p>"There," Her Majesty said. "You
see? Telepaths do go insane&mdash;it's sort
of an occupational disease. Of course,
not all of them are insane."</p>

<p>"Not all of them?" Malone felt
the faint stirrings of hope. Perhaps
they would turn up a telepath yet
who was completely sane and rational.</p>

<p>"There's me, of course," Her Majesty
said.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara gulped audibly. Boyd
said nothing, but gripped the wheel
of the car more tightly.</p>

<p>And Malone thought to himself:
<i>That's right. There's Queen Elizabeth&mdash;who
says she isn't crazy.</i></p>

<p>And then he thought of one more
sane telepath. But the knowledge did
not make him feel any better.</p>

<p>It was, of course, the spy.</p>

<p>How many more are going to turn
up? Malone wondered.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's about all of us," the
Queen said. "There is one more, but
she's in a hospital in Honolulu, and
your men won't find her until tomorrow."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 455px;">
<img src="images/008.png" width="455" height="500" alt="" title="" />
Sir Thomas Boyd ... looking majestic.</div>



<p>Boyd turned. "Do you mean you
can foretell the future, too?" he asked
in a strained voice.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara screamed: "Keep
your eyes on the wheel and your
hands on the road!"</p>

<p>"What?" Boyd said.</p>

<p>There was a terrific blast of noise,
and a truck went by in the opposite
direction. The driver, a big, ugly man
with no hair on his head, leaned out
to curse at the quartet, but his mouth
remained open. He stared at the four
Elizabethans and said nothing at all as
he whizzed by.</p>

<p>"What was that?" Boyd asked
faintly.</p>

<p>"That," Malone snapped, "was a
truck. And it was due entirely to the
mercy of God that we didn't hit it.
Barbara's right. Keep your eyes on the
wheel and your hands on the road."
He paused and thought that over.
Then he said: "Does that mean anything
at all?"</p>

<p>"Lady Barbara was confused by the
excitement," the Queen said calmly.
"It's all right now, dear."</p>

<p>Lady Barbara blinked across the
seat. "I was&mdash;afraid," she said.</p>

<p>"It's all right," the Queen said.
"I'll take care of you."</p>

<p>"This," Malone announced to no
one in particular, "is ridiculous."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Boyd swept the car around a curve
and concentrated grimly on the road.
After a second the Queen said: "Since
you're still thinking about the question,
I'll answer you."</p>

<p>"What question?" Malone said,
thoroughly baffled.</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas asked me if I could
foretell the future," the Queen said
equably. "Of course I can't. That's
silly. Just because I'm immortal and
I'm a telepath, don't go hog-wild."</p>

<p>"Then how did you know the FBI
agents were going to find the girl in
Honolulu tomorrow?" Boyd said.</p>

<p>"Because," the Queen said, "they're
thinking about looking in the hospital
tomorrow, and when they look they'll
certainly find her."</p>

<p>Boyd said: "Oh," and was silent.</p>

<p>But Malone had a grim question.
"Why didn't you tell me about these
other telepaths before?" he said.
"You could have saved us a lot of
work."</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens to Betsy, Sir Kenneth,"
Her Majesty exclaimed. "How
could I? After all, the proper precautions
had to be taken first, didn't
they? I told you all the others were
crazy&mdash;<i>really</i> crazy, I mean. And they
just wouldn't be safe without the
proper precautions."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you ought to go back to
the hospital, too," Barbara said, and
added: "Your Majesty," just in time.</p>

<p>"But if I did, dear," Her Majesty
said, "you'd lose your chance to become
a Duchess, and that wouldn't
be at all nice. Besides, I'm having so
much <i>fun</i>!" She trilled a laugh again.
"Riding around like this is just wonderful!"
she said.</p>

<p><i>And you're important for national
security</i>, Malone said to himself.</p>

<p>"That's right, Sir Kenneth," the
Queen said. "The country needs me,
and I'm happy to serve. That is the
job of a sovereign."</p>

<p>"Fine," Malone said, hoping it was.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Her Majesty,
"that settles that. We have a whole
night ahead of us, Sir Kenneth. What
do you say we make a night <i>of</i> it?"</p>

<p>"Knight who?" Malone said. He
felt confused again. It seemed as if
he was always feeling confused lately.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Sir Kenneth," Her
Majesty said. "There are times and
times."</p>

<p>"Sure," Malone said at random.
<i>And time and a half</i>, he thought. <i>Possibly
for overtime.</i> "What is Your
Majesty thinking of?" he asked with
trepidation.</p>

<p>"I want to take a tour of Las
Vegas," Her Majesty said primly.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara shook her head. "I'm
afraid that's not possible, Your Majesty,"
she said.</p>

<p>"And why not, pray?" Her Majesty
said. "No. I can see what you're
thinking. It's not safe to let me go
wandering around in a strange city,
and particularly if that city is Las
Vegas. Well, dear, I can assure you
that it's perfectly safe."</p>

<p>"We've got work to do," Boyd
contributed.</p>

<p>Malone said nothing. He stared
bleakly at the hood ornament on the
car.</p>

<p>"I have made my wishes known,"
the Queen said.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara said: "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>Boyd, however, knew when to give
in. "Yes, Your Majesty," he said.</p>

<p>She smiled graciously at him, and
answered Lady Barbara only by a
slight lift of her regal eyebrow.</p>

<p>Malone had been thinking about
something else. When he was sure he
had a firm grip on himself he turned.
"Your Majesty, tell me something,"
he said. "You can read my mind,
right?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, Sir Kenneth,"
Her Majesty said. "I thought I'd
proved that to you. And, as for what
you're about to ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," Malone said. "Please. Let
me ask the questions before you answer
them. It's less confusing that
way. I'll cheerfully admit that it
shouldn't be&mdash;but it is. Please?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Sir Kenneth, if you
wish," the Queen said. She folded her
hands in her lap and waited quietly.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"O.K.," Malone said. "Now, if you
can read my mind, then you must
know that I don't <i>really</i> believe that
you are Queen Elizabeth of England.
The First, I mean."</p>

<p>"Mr. Malone," Barbara Wilson
said suddenly. "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's all right, child," the Queen
said. "He doesn't disturb me. And I
do wish you'd call him Sir Kenneth.
That's his title, you know."</p>

<p>"Now that's what I mean," Malone
said. "Why do you want us to <i>act</i> as
if we believe you, when you know
we don't?"</p>

<p>"Because that's the way people do
act," the Queen said calmly. "Very
few people really believe that their
so-called superiors <i>are</i> superior. Almost
none of them do, in fact."</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute," Boyd began.</p>

<p>"No, no, it's quite true," the Queen
said, "and, unpleasant as it may be,
we must learn to face the truth. That's
the path of sanity." Lady Barbara
made a strangled noise but Her Majesty
continued, unruffled. "Nearly
everybody suffers from the silly delusion
that he's possibly equal to, but
very probably superior to, everybody
else ... my goodness, where would
we be if that were true?"</p>

<p>Malone felt that a comment was
called for, and he made one. "Who
knows?" he said.</p>

<p>"All the things people do toward
their superiors," the Queen said, "are
done for social reasons. For instance,
Sir Kenneth: you don't realize fully
how you feel about Mr. Burris."</p>

<p>"He's a nice guy," Malone said. "I
work for him. He's a good Director
of the FBI."</p>

<p>"Of course," the Queen said. "But
you believe you could do the job just
as well, or perhaps a little better."</p>

<p>"I do not," Malone said angrily.</p>

<p>Her Majesty reserved a dignified
silence.</p>

<p>After a while Malone said: "And
what if I do?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing," Her Majesty
said. "You don't think Mr. Burris is
any smarter or better than you are&mdash;but
you treat him as if you did. All
I am insisting on is the same treatment."</p>

<p>"But if we don't believe&mdash;" Boyd
began.</p>

<p>"Bless you," Her Majesty said, "I
can't help the way you <i>think</i>, but, as
Queen, I do have some control over
the way you <i>act</i>."</p>

<p>Malone thought it over. "You have
a point there," he said at last.</p>

<p>Barbara said: "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Kenneth," the Queen
said, "I do." She seemed to be ignoring
Lady Barbara. Perhaps, Malone
thought, she was still angry over the
nap affair. "It's not that," the Queen
said.</p>

<p>"Not what?" Boyd said, thoroughly
confused.</p>

<p>"Not the naps," the Queen said.</p>

<p>"What naps?" Boyd said.</p>

<p>Malone said: "I was thinking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good," Boyd said. "Keep it up.
I'm driving. Everything's going to hell
around me, but I'm driving."</p>

<p>A red light appeared ahead. Boyd
jammed on the brakes with somewhat
more than the necessary force, and
Malone was thrown forward with a
grunt. Behind him there were two
ladylike squeals.</p>

<p>Malone struggled upright. "Barbara?"
he called. "Are you all
right&mdash;" Then he remembered the
Queen.</p>

<p>"It's all right," Her Majesty said.
"I can understand your concern for
Lady Barbara." She smiled at Malone
as he turned.</p>

<p>Malone gaped at her. Of course she
knew what he thought about Barbara;
she'd been reading his mind. And, apparently,
she was on his side. That
was good, even though it made him
slightly nervous to think about.</p>

<p>"Now," the Queen said suddenly,
"what about tonight?"</p>

<p>"Tonight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," the Queen said.
She smiled, and put up a hand to pat
at her white hair under the Elizabethan
skullcap. "I think I should
like to go to the Palace," she said.
"After all, isn't that where a Queen
should be?"</p>

<p>Boyd said, in a kind of explosion:
"London? England?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me&mdash;" the Queen began,
and Barbara said:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that I simply can't allow
anything like that. Overseas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean overseas, dear," Her
Majesty said. "Sir Kenneth, please
explain to these people."</p>

<p>The Palace, Malone knew, was
more properly known as the Golden
Palace. It was right in Las Vegas&mdash;convenient
to all sources of money.
As a matter of fact, it was one of the
biggest gambling houses along the
Las Vegas strip, a veritable chaos of
wheels, cards, dice, chips and other
such devices. Malone explained all
this to the others, wondering meanwhile
why Miss Thompson wanted to
go there.</p>

<p>"<i>Not</i> Miss Thompson, <i>please</i>, Sir
Kenneth," Her Majesty said.</p>

<p>"Not Miss Thompson what?"
Boyd said. "What's going on anyhow?"</p>

<p>"She's reading my mind," Malone
said.</p>

<p>"Well, then," Boyd snapped, "tell
her to keep it to herself." The car
started up again with a roar and Malone
and the others were thrown
around again, this time toward the
back. There was a chorus of groans
and squeals, and they were on their
way once more.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"To reply to your question, Sir
Kenneth," the Queen said.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara said, with some composure:
"What question ... Your
Majesty?"</p>

<p>The Queen nodded regally at her.
"Sir Kenneth was wondering why I
wished to go to the Golden Palace,"
she said. "And my reply is this: it is
none of your business why I want to
go there. After all, is my word law,
or isn't it?"</p>

<p>There didn't seem to be a good
enough answer to that, Malone
thought sadly. He kept quiet and was
relieved to note that the others did
the same. However, after a second he
thought of something else.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," he began carefully,
"we've got to go to Yucca Flats
tomorrow. Remember?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," the Queen said. "My
memory is quite good, thank you. But
that is tomorrow morning. We have
the rest of the night left. It's only a
little after nine, you know."</p>

<p>"Heavens," Barbara said. "Is it that
late?"</p>

<p>"It's even later," Boyd said sourly.
"It's much later than you think."</p>

<p>"And it's getting later all the time,"
Malone added. "Pretty soon the sun
will go out and all life on earth will
end. Won't that be nice and peaceful?"</p>

<p>"I'm looking forward to it," Boyd
said.</p>

<p>"I'm not," Barbara said. "But I've
got to get some sleep tonight, if I'm
going to be any good at all tomorrow."</p>

<p><i>You're pretty good right now</i>,
Malone thought, but he didn't say a
word. He felt the Queen's eye on him
but didn't turn around. After all, she
was on his side&mdash;wasn't she?</p>

<p>At any rate, she didn't say anything.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be best," Barbara
said, "if you and I ... Your
Majesty ... just went home and
rested up. Some other time, then,
when there's nothing vital to do, we
could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," the Queen said. "We
couldn't. Really, Lady Barbara, how
often will I have to remind you of
the duties you owe your sovereign&mdash;not
the least of which is obedience,
as dear old Ben used to say."</p>

<p>"Ben?" Malone said, and immediately
wished he hadn't.</p>

<p>"Jonson, dear boy," the Queen
said. "Really a remarkable man&mdash;and
such a good friend to poor Will.
Why, did you ever hear the story of
how he actually paid Will's rent in
London once upon a time? That was
while Will and that Anne of his were
having one of their arguments, of
course. I didn't tell you that story,
did I?"</p>

<p>"No," Malone said truthfully, but
his voice was full of foreboding. "If
I might remind Your Majesty of the
subject," he added tentatively, "I
should like to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Remind me of the subject!" the
Queen said, obviously delighted.
"What a lovely pun! And how much
better because purely unconscious!
My, my, Sir Kenneth, I never suspected
you of a pointed sense of humor&mdash;could
you be a descendant of Sir
Richard Greene, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it," Malone said. "My ancestors
were all poor but Irish." He
paused. "Or, if you prefer, Irish but
poor." Another pause, and then he
added: "If that means anything at
all. Which I doubt."</p>

<p>"In any case," the Queen said, her
eyes twinkling, "you were about to
enter a new objection to our little
visit to the Palace, were you not?"</p>

<p>Malone admitted as much. "I really
think that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her eyes grew suddenly cold. "If
I hear any more objections, Sir Kenneth,
I shall not only rescind your
knighthood and&mdash;when I regain my
rightful kingdom&mdash;deny you your
dukedom, but I shall refuse to co-operate
any further in the business of
Project Isle."</p>

<p>Malone turned cold. His face, he
knew without glancing in the mirror,
was white and pale. He thought of
what Burris would do to him if he
didn't follow through on his assigned
job.</p>

<p>Even if he wasn't as good as Burris
thought he was, he really liked being
an FBI agent. He didn't want to be
fired.</p>

<p>And Burris had said: "<i>Give her
anything she wants.</i>"</p>

<p>He gulped and tried to make his
face look normal. "All right," he
said. "Fine. We'll go to the Palace."</p>

<p>He tried to ignore the pall of apprehension
that fell over the car.</p>



<hr class="hrchp" />
<h2>VI</h2>


<p>The management of the Golden
Palace had been in business for many
long, dreary, profitable years, and
each member of the staff thought he
or she had seen just about everything
there was to be seen. And those that
were new felt an obligation to <i>look</i>
as if they'd seen everything.</p>

<p>Therefore, when the entourage of
Queen Elizabeth I strolled into the
main salon, not a single eye was batted.
Not a single gasp was heard.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the staff kept a discreet
eye on the crew. Drunks, rich
men or Arabian millionaires were all
familiar. But a group out of the Sixteenth
Century was something else
again.</p>

<p>Malone almost strutted, conscious
of the sidelong glances the group was
drawing. But it was obvious that Sir
Thomas was the major attraction.
Even if you could accept the idea of
people in strange costumes, the sight
of a living, breathing absolute duplicate
of King Henry VIII was a little
too much to take. It has been reported
that two ladies named Jane, and one
named Catherine, came down with
sudden headaches and left the salon
within five minutes of the group's
arrival.</p>

<p>Malone felt he knew, however, why
he wasn't drawing his full share of attention.
He felt a little out of place.
The costume was one thing, and, to
tell the truth, he was beginning to enjoy
it. Even with the weight of the
stuff, it was going to be a wrench to
go back to single-breasted suits and
plain white shirts. But he did feel that
he should have been carrying a sword.</p>

<p>Instead, he had a .44 Magnum Colt
snuggled beneath his left armpit.</p>

<p>Somehow, a .44 Magnum Colt
didn't seem as romantic as a sword.
Malone pictured himself saying:
"Take that, varlet." Was varlet what
you called them? he wondered. Maybe
it was valet.</p>

<p>"Take that, valet," he muttered.
No, that sounded even worse. Oh,
well, he could look it up later.</p>

<p>The truth was that he had been
born in the wrong century. He could
imagine himself at the Mermaid Tavern,
hob-nobbing with Shakespeare
and all the rest of them. He wondered
if Sir Richard Greene would be there.
Then he wondered who Sir Richard
Greene was.</p>

<p>Behind Sir Kenneth, Sir Thomas
Boyd strode, looking majestic, as if
he were about to fling purses of gold
to the citizenry. As a matter of fact,
Malone thought, he was. They all
were.</p>

<p>Purses of good old United States
of America gold.</p>

<p>Behind Sir Thomas came Queen
Elizabeth and her Lady-in-Waiting,
Lady Barbara Wilson. They made a
beautiful foursome.</p>

<p>"The roulette table," Her Majesty
said with dignity. "Precede me."</p>

<p>They pushed their way through the
crowd. Most of the customers were
either excited enough, drunk enough,
or both to see nothing in the least incongruous
about a Royal Family of the
Tudors invading the Golden Palace.
Very few of them, as a matter of fact,
seemed to notice the group.</p>

<p>They were roulette players. They
noticed nothing but the table and the
wheel. Malone wondered what they
were thinking about, decided to ask
Queen Elizabeth, and then decided
against it. He felt it would make him
nervous to know.</p>

<p>Her Majesty took a handful of
chips.</p>

<p>The handful was worth, Malone
knew, exactly five thousand dollars.
That, he'd thought, ought to last them
an evening, even in the Golden Palace.
In the center of the strip, inside the
city limits of Las Vegas itself, the
five thousand would have lasted much
longer&mdash;but Her Majesty wanted the
Palace, and the Palace it was.</p>

<p>Malone began to smile. Since he
couldn't avoid the evening, he was
determined to enjoy it. It was sort of
fun, in its way, indulging a sweet
harmless old lady. And there was
nothing they could do until the next
morning, anyhow.</p>

<p>His indulgent smile faded very
suddenly.</p>

<p>Her Majesty plunked the entire
handful of chips&mdash;<i>five thousand dollars!</i>
Malone thought dazedly&mdash;onto
the table. "Five thousand," she said
in clear, cool measured tones, "on
Number One."</p>

<p>The croupier blinked only slightly.
He bowed. "Yes, Your Majesty," he
said.</p>

<p>Malone was briefly thankful, in the
midst of his black horror, that he had
called the management and told them
that the Queen's plays were backed by
the United States Government. Her
Majesty was going to get unlimited
credit&mdash;and a good deal of awed and
somewhat puzzled respect.</p>

<p>Malone watched the spin begin
with mixed feelings. There was five
thousand dollars riding on the little
ball. But, after all, Her Majesty was
a telepath. Did that mean anything?</p>

<p>He hadn't decided by the time the
wheel stopped, and by then he didn't
have to decide.</p>

<p>"Thirty-four," the croupier said
tonelessly. "Red, Even and High."</p>

<p>He raked in the chips with a nonchalant
air.</p>

<p>Malone felt as if he had swallowed
his stomach. Boyd and Lady Barbara,
standing nearby, had absolutely no
expressions on their faces. Malone
needed no telepath to tell him what
they were thinking.</p>

<p>They were exactly the same as he
was. They were incapable of thought.</p>

<p>But Her Majesty never batted an
eyelash. "Come, Sir Kenneth," she
said. "Let's go on to the poker tables."</p>

<p>She swept out. Her entourage followed
her, shambling a little, and
blank-eyed. Malone was still thinking
about the five thousand dollars. Oh,
well, Burris had said to give the lady
anything she wanted. <i>But!</i> he thought.
<i>Did she have to play for royal stakes?</i></p>

<p>"I am, after all, a Queen," she
whispered back to him.</p>

<p>Malone thought about the National
Debt. He wondered if a million more
or less would make any real difference.
There would be questions asked in
committees about it. He tried to imagine
himself explaining the evening
to a group of congressmen. "Well,
you see, gentlemen, there was this
roulette wheel&mdash;"</p>

<p>He gave it up.</p>

<p>Then he wondered how much hotter
the water was going to get, and
he stopped thinking altogether in self-defense.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the next room, there were scattered
tables. At one, a poker game was
in full swing. Only five were playing;
one, by his white-tie-and-tails uniform,
was easily recognizable as a
house dealer. The other four were all
men, one of them in full cowboy
regalia. The Tudors descended upon
them with great suddenness, and the
house dealer looked up and almost
lost his cigarette.</p>

<p>"We haven't any money, Your
Majesty," Malone whispered.</p>

<p>She smiled up at him sweetly, and
then drew him aside. "If you were a
telepath," she said, "how would <i>you</i>
play poker?"</p>

<p>Malone thought about that for a
minute, and then turned to look for
Boyd. But Sir Thomas didn't even
have to be given instructions. "Another
five hundred?" he said.</p>

<p>Her Majesty sniffed audibly. "Another
five thousand," she said regally.</p>

<p>Boyd looked Malone-wards. Malone
looked defeated.</p>

<p>Boyd turned with a small sigh and
headed for the cashier's booth. Three
minutes later, he was back with a fat
fistful of chips.</p>

<p>"Five grand?" Malone whispered
to him.</p>

<p>"Ten," Boyd said. "I know when
to back a winner."</p>

<p>Her Majesty went over to the table.
The dealer had regained control, but
looked up at them with a puzzled
stare.</p>

<p>"You know," the Queen said, with
an obvious attempt to put the man
at his ease, "I've always wanted to
visit a gambling hall."</p>

<p>"Sure, lady," the dealer said. "Naturally."</p>

<p>"May I sit down?"</p>

<p>The dealer looked at the group.
"How about your friends?" he said
cautiously.</p>

<p>The Queen shook her head. "They
would rather watch, I'm sure."</p>

<p>For once Malone blessed the woman's
telepathic talent. He, Boyd and
Barbara Wilson formed a kind of
Guard of Honor around the chair
which Her Majesty occupied. Boyd
handed over the new pile of chips,
and was favored with a royal smile.</p>

<p>"This is a poker game, ma'am," the
dealer said to her, quietly.</p>

<p>"I know, I know," Her Majesty
said with a trace of testiness. "Roll
'em."</p>

<p>The dealer stared at her popeyed.
Next to her, the gentleman in the
cowboy outfit turned. "Ma'am, are you
from around these parts?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," the Queen said. "I'm
from England."</p>

<p>"England?" The cowboy looked
puzzled. "You don't seem to have any
accent, ma'am," he said at last.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," the Queen said.
"I've lost that; I've been over here
a great many years."</p>

<p>Malone hoped fervently that Her
Majesty wouldn't mention just how
many years. He didn't think he could
stand it, and he was almost grateful
for the cowboy's nasal twang.</p>

<p>"Oil?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Her Majesty said. "The
Government is providing this money."</p>

<p>"The Government?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Her Majesty said.
"The FBI, you know."</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>At last, the dealer said: "Five-card
draw your game, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"If you please," Her Majesty said.</p>

<p>The dealer shrugged and, apparently,
commended his soul to a gambler's
God. He passed the pasteboards
around the table with the air of one
who will have nothing more to do
with the world.</p>

<p>Her Majesty picked up her hand.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 114px; margin-bottom: 0;">

<div class="figright" style="width: 332px; margin-top: 0;">
<img src="images/009-2.png" style="display: block;" width="332" height="381" alt="" title="" />
"May I raise ... five thousand?"</div>



<p>"The ante's ten, ma'am," the dealer
said softly.</p>

<p>Without looking, Her Majesty removed
a ten-dollar chip from the
pile before her and sent it spinning
to the middle of the table.</p>

<p>The dealer opened his mouth, but
said nothing. Malone, meanwhile, was
peering over the Queen's shoulder.</p>

<p>She held a pair of nines, a four, a
three and a Jack.</p>

<p>The man to the left of the dealer
announced glumly: "Can't open."</p>

<p>The next man grinned. "Open for
twenty," he said.</p>

<p>Malone closed his eyes. He heard
the cowboy say: "I'm in," and he
opened his eyes again. The Queen
was pushing two ten-dollar chips toward
the center of the table.</p>

<p>The next man dropped, and the
dealer looked round the table. "How
many?"</p>

<p>The man who couldn't open took
three cards. The man who'd opened
for twenty stood pat. Malone shuddered
invisibly. That, he figured,
meant at least a straight. And Queen
Elizabeth Thompson was going in
against a straight or better with a
pair of nines, Jack high.</p>

<p>For the first time, it was borne in
on Malone that being a telepath did
not necessarily mean that you were
a good poker player. Even if you
knew what every other person at the
table held, you could still make a
whole lot of stupid mistakes.</p>

<p>He looked nervously at Queen
Elizabeth, but her face was serene.
Apparently she'd been following the
thoughts of the poker players, and not
concentrating on him at all. That was
a relief. He felt, for the first time in
days, as if he could think freely.</p>

<p>The cowboy said: "Two," and took
them. It was Her Majesty's turn.</p>

<p>"I'll take two," she said, and threw
away the three and four. It left her
with the nine of spades and the nine
of hearts, and the Jack of diamonds.</p>

<p>These were joined, in a matter of
seconds, by two bright new cards: the
six of clubs and the three of hearts.</p>

<p>Malone closed his eyes. Oh, well,
he thought.</p>

<p>It was only thirty bucks down the
drain. Practically nothing.</p>

<p>Of course Her Majesty dropped at
once; knowing what the other players
held, she knew she couldn't beat
them after the draw. But she did like
to take long chances, Malone thought
miserably. Imagine trying to fill a full
house on one pair!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Slowly, as the minutes passed, the
pile of chips before Her Majesty
dwindled. Once Malone saw her win
with two pair against a reckless man
trying to fill a straight on the other
side of the table. But whatever was
going on, Her Majesty's face was as
calm as if she were asleep.</p>

<p>Malone's worked overtime. If the
Queen hadn't been losing so obviously,
the dealer might have mistaken
the play of naked emotion across his
visage for a series of particularly obvious
signals.</p>

<p>An hour went by. Barbara left to
find a ladies' lounge where she could
sit down and try to relax. Fascinated
in a horrible sort of way, both Malone
and Boyd stood, rooted to the spot,
while hand after hand went by and
the ten thousand dollars dwindled to
half that, to a quarter, and even less&mdash;</p>

<p>Her Majesty, it seemed, was a
mighty poor poker player.</p>

<p>The ante had been raised by this
time. Her Majesty was losing one
hundred dollars a hand, even before
the betting began. But she showed
not the slightest indication to stop.</p>

<p>"We've got to get up in the morning,"
Malone announced to no one
in particular, when he thought he
couldn't possibly stand another half
hour of the game.</p>

<p>"So we do," Her Majesty said with
a little regretful sigh. "Very well,
then. Just one more hand."</p>

<p>"It's a shame to lose you," the cowboy
said to her, quite sincerely. He
had been winning steadily ever since
Her Majesty sat down, and Malone
thought that the man should, by this
time, be awfully grateful to the United
States Government. Somehow, he
doubted that this gratitude existed.</p>

<p>Malone wondered if she should be
allowed to stay for one more hand.
There was, he estimated, about two
thousand dollars in front of her. Then
he wondered how he was going to
stop her.</p>

<p>The cards were dealt.</p>

<p>The first man said quietly: "Open
for two hundred."</p>

<p>Malone looked at the Queen's
hand. It contained the Ace, King,
Queen and ten of clubs&mdash;and the
seven of spades.</p>

<p><i>Oh, no</i>, he thought. <i>She couldn't
possibly be thinking of filling a flush.</i></p>

<p>He knew perfectly well that she
was.</p>

<p>The second man said: "And raise
two hundred."</p>

<p>The Queen equably tossed&mdash;counting,
Malone thought, the ante&mdash;five
hundred into the pot.</p>

<p>The cowboy muttered to himself
for a second, and finally shoved in his
money.</p>

<p>"I think I'll raise it another five
hundred," the Queen said calmly.</p>

<p>Malone wanted to die of shock.
Unfortunately, he remained alive and
watching. He was the last man, after
some debate internal, to shove a total
of one thousand dollars into the
pot.</p>

<p>"Cards?" said the dealer.</p>

<p>The first man said: "One."</p>

<p>It was too much to hope for, Malone
thought. If that first man were
trying to fill a straight or a flush, maybe
he wouldn't make it. And maybe
something final would happen to all
the other players. But that was the
only way he could see for Her Majesty
to win.</p>

<p>The card was dealt. The second
man stood pat and Malone's green
tinge became obvious to the veriest
dunce. The cowboy, on Her Majesty's
right, asked for a card, received it and
sat back without a trace of expression.</p>

<p>The Queen said: "I'll try one for
size." She'd picked up poker lingo,
and the basic rules of the game, Malone
realized, from the other players&mdash;or
possibly from someone at the
hospital itself, years ago.</p>

<p>He wished she'd picked up something
less dangerous instead, like a
love of big-game hunting, or stunt-flying.</p>

<p>But no. It had to be poker.</p>

<p>The Queen threw away her seven
of spades, showing more sense than
Malone had given her credit for at
any time during the game. She let the
other card fall and didn't look at it.</p>

<p>She smiled up at Malone and Boyd.
"Live dangerously," she said gaily.</p>

<p>Malone gave her a hollow laugh.</p>

<p>The last man drew one card, too,
and the betting began.</p>

<p>The Queen's remaining thousand
was gone before an eye could notice
it. She turned to Boyd.</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas," she said. "Another
five thousand, please. At once."</p>

<p>Boyd said nothing at all, but
marched off. Malone noticed, however,
that his step was neither as
springy nor as confident as it had been
before. For himself, Malone was sure
that he could not walk at all.</p>

<p>Maybe, he thought hopefully, the
floor would open up and swallow
them all. He tried to imagine explaining
the loss of twenty thousand dollars
to Burris and some congressmen,
and after that he watched the floor
narrowly, hoping for the smallest hint
of a crack in the palazzo marble.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"May I raise the whole five thousand?"
the Queen said.</p>

<p>"It's O.K. with me," the dealer
said. "How about the rest of you?"</p>

<p>The four grunts he got expressed a
suppressed eagerness. The Queen
took the new chips Boyd had brought
her and shoved them into the center
of the table with a fine, careless gesture
of her hand. She smiled gaily at
everybody. "Seeing me?" she said.</p>

<p>Everybody was.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it was this way,"
Malone muttered to himself, rehearsing.
He half-thought that one of the
others would raise again, but no one
did. After all, each of them must be
convinced that he held a great hand,
and though raising had gone on
throughout the hand, each must now
be afraid of going the least little bit
too far and scaring the others out.</p>

<p>"Mr. Congressman," Malone muttered,
"there's this game called poker.
You play it with cards and money.
Chiefly money."</p>

<p>That wasn't any good.</p>

<p>"You've been called," the dealer
said to the first man, who'd opened
the hand a year or so before.</p>

<p>"Why, sure," the player said, and
laid down a pair of aces, a pair of
threes&mdash;and a four. One of the threes,
and the four, were clubs. That reduced
the already improbable chances
of the Queen's coming up with a
flush.</p>

<p>"Sorry," said the second man, and
laid down a straight with a single
gesture. The straight was nine-high
and there were no clubs in it. Malone
felt devoutly thankful for that.</p>

<p>The second man reached for the
money but, under the popeyed gaze
of the dealer, the fifth man laid down
another straight&mdash;this one ten-high.
The nine was a club. Malone felt the
odds go down, right in his own
stomach.</p>

<p>And now the cowboy put down his
cards. The King of diamonds. The
King of hearts. The Jack of diamonds.
The Jack of spades. And&mdash;the Jack of
hearts.</p>

<p>Full house. "Well," said the cowboy.
"I suppose that does it."</p>

<p>The Queen said: "Please. One moment."</p>

<p>The cowboy stopped halfway in his
reach for the enormous pile of chips.
The Queen laid down her four clubs&mdash;Ace,
King, Queen and ten&mdash;and for
the first time flipped over her fifth
card.</p>

<p>It was the Jack of clubs.</p>

<p>"My God," the cowboy said, and
it sounded like a prayer. "A royal
flush."</p>

<p>"Naturally," the Queen said.
"What else?"</p>

<p>Her Majesty calmly scooped up the
tremendous pile of chips. The cowboy's
hands fell away. Five mouths
were open around the table.</p>

<p>Her Majesty stood up. She smiled
sweetly at the men around the table.
"Thank you very much, gentlemen,"
she said. She handed the chips to Malone,
who took them in nerveless fingers.
"Sir Kenneth," she said, "I
hereby appoint you temporary Chancellor
of the Exchequer&mdash;at least until
Parliament convenes."</p>

<p>There was, Malone thought, at least
thirty-five thousand dollars in the pile.
He could think of nothing to say.</p>

<p>So, instead of using up words, he
went and cashed in the chips. For
once, he realized, the Government
had made money on an investment. It
was probably the first time since 1775.</p>

<p>Malone thought vaguely that the
Government ought to make more investments
like the one he was cashing
in. If it did, the National Debt could
be wiped out in a matter of days.</p>

<p>He brought the money back. Boyd
and the Queen were waiting for him,
but Barbara was still in the ladies'
lounge. "She's on the way out," the
Queen informed him, and, sure
enough, in a minute they saw the figure
approaching them. Malone smiled
at her, and, tentatively, she smiled
back. They began the long march to
the exit of the club, slowly and
regally, though not by choice.</p>

<p>The crowd, it seemed, wouldn't let
them go. Malone never found out,
then or later, how the news of Her
Majesty's winnings had gone through
the place so fast, but everyone seemed
to know about it. The Queen was the
recipient of several low bows and a
few drunken curtsies, and, when they
reached the front door at last, the
doorman said in a most respectful
tone: "Good evening, Your Majesty."</p>

<p>The Queen positively beamed at
him. So, to his own great surprise,
did Sir Kenneth Malone.</p>

<p>Outside, it was about four in the
morning. They climbed into the car
and headed back toward the hotel.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Malone was the first to speak.
"How did you know that was a Jack
of clubs?" he said in a strangled sort
of voice.</p>

<p>The little old lady said calmly: "He
was cheating."</p>

<p>"The dealer?" Malone asked.</p>

<p>The little old lady nodded.</p>

<p>"In <i>your</i> favor?"</p>

<p>"He couldn't have been cheating,"
Boyd said at the same instant. "Why
would he want to give you all that
money?"</p>

<p>The little old lady shook her head.
"He didn't want to give it to me,"
she said. "He wanted to give it to the
man in the cowboy's suit. His name is
Elliott, by the way&mdash;Bernard L.
Elliott. And he comes from Weehawken.
But he pretends to be a
Westerner so nobody will be suspicious
of him. He and the dealer are
in cahoots ... isn't that the word?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Majesty," Boyd said.
"That's the word." His tone was awed
and respectful, and the little old lady
gave a nod and became Queen Elizabeth
I once more.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "the dealer and
Mr. Elliott were in cahoots, and the
dealer wanted to give the hand to Mr.
Elliott. But he made a mistake, and
dealt the Jack of clubs to me. I watched
him, and, of course, I knew what
he was thinking. The rest was
easy."</p>

<p>"My God," Malone said. "Easy."</p>

<p>Barbara said: "Did she win?"</p>

<p>"She won," Malone said with what
he felt was positively magnificent
understatement.</p>

<p>"Good," Barbara said, and lost interest
at once.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Malone had seen the lights of a
car in the rear-view mirror a few minutes
before. When he looked now, the
lights were still there&mdash;but the fact
just didn't register until, a couple of
blocks later, the car began to pull
around them on the left. It was a
Buick, while Boyd's was a new Lincoln,
but the edge wasn't too apparent
yet.</p>

<p>Malone spotted the gun barrel
protruding from the Buick and yelled
just before the first shot went off.</p>

<p>Boyd, at the wheel, didn't even
bother to look. His reflexes took over
and he slammed his foot down on the
brake. The specially-built FBI Lincoln
slowed down instantly. The shotgun
blast splattered the glass of the curved
windshield all over&mdash;but none of it
came into the car itself.</p>

<p>Malone already had his hand on the
butt of the .44 Magnum under his left
armpit, and he even had time to be
grateful, for once, that it wasn't a
smallsword. The women were in the
back seat, frozen, and he yelled:
"Duck!" and felt, rather than saw,
both of them sink down onto the floor
of the car.</p>

<p>The Buick had slowed down, too,
and the gun barrel was swiveling back
for a second shot. Malone felt naked
and unprotected. The Buick and the
Lincoln were even on the road
now.</p>

<p>Malone had his revolver out. He
fired the first shot without even realizing
fully that he'd done so, and he
heard a piercing scream from Barbara
in the back seat. He had no time to
look back.</p>

<p>A .44 Magnum is not, by any
means, a small gun. As hand guns go&mdash;revolvers
and automatics&mdash;it is
about as large as a gun can get to be.
An ordinary car has absolutely no
chance against it.</p>

<p>Much less the glass in an ordinary
car.</p>

<p>The first slug drilled its way
through the window glass as though
it were not there, and slammed its way
through an even more unprotected
obstacle, the frontal bones of the
triggerman's skull. The second slug
from Malone's gun missed the hole
the first slug had made by something
less than an inch.</p>

<p>The big, apelike thug who was
holding the shotgun had a chance to
pull the trigger once more, but he
wasn't aiming very well. The blast
merely scored the paint off the top of
the Lincoln.</p>

<p>The rear window of the Buick was
open, and Malone caught sight of another
glint of blued steel from the
corner of his eye. There was no time
to shift aim&mdash;not with bullets flying
like swallows on the way to Capistrano.
Malone thought faster than he
had ever imagined himself capable of
doing, and decided to aim for the
driver.</p>

<p>Evidently the man in the rear seat
of the Buick had had the same inspiration.
Malone blasted two more
high-velocity lead slugs at the driver
of the big Buick, and at the same time
the man in the Buick's rear seat fired
at Boyd.</p>

<p>But Boyd had shifted tactics. He'd
hit the brakes. Now he came down
hard on the accelerator instead.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The chorus of shrieks from the
Lincoln's back seat increased slightly
in volume. Barbara, Malone knew,
wasn't badly hurt; she hadn't even
stopped for breath since the first shot
had been fired. Anybody who could
scream like that, he told himself, had
to be healthy.</p>

<p>As the Lincoln leaped ahead, Malone
pulled the trigger of his .44 twice
more. The heavy, high-speed chunks
of streamlined copper-coated lead
leaped from the muzzle of the gun
and slammed into the driver of the
Buick without wasting any time. The
Buick slewed across the highway.</p>

<p>The two shots fired by the man in
the back seat went past Malone's head
with a <i>whizz</i>, missing both him and
Boyd by a margin too narrow to think
about.</p>

<p>But those were the last shots. The
only difference between the FBI and
the Enemy seemed to be determination
and practice.</p>

<p>The Buick spun into a flat sideskid,
swiveled on its wheels and slammed
into the ditch at the side of the road,
turning over and over, making a horrible noise,
as it broke up.</p>

<p>Boyd slowed the car again, just as
there was a sudden blast of fire. The
Buick had burst into flame and was
spitting heat and smoke and fire in
all directions. Malone sent one more
bullet after it in a last flurry of action&mdash;saving
his last one for possible later
emergencies.</p>

<p>Boyd jammed on the brakes and the
Lincoln came to a screaming halt. In
silence he and Malone watched the
burning Buick roll over and over into
the desert beyond the shoulder.</p>

<p>"My God," Boyd said. "My ears!"</p>

<p>Malone understood at once. The
blast from his own still-smoking .44
had roared past Boyd's head during
the gun battle. No wonder the man's
ears hurt. It was a wonder he wasn't
altogether deaf.</p>

<p>But Boyd shook off the pain and
brought out his own .44 as he stepped
out of the car. Malone followed
him, his gun trained.</p>

<p>From the rear, Her Majesty said:
"It's safe to rise now, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You ought to know," Malone said.
"You can tell if they're still alive."</p>

<p>There was silence while Queen
Elizabeth frowned for a moment in
concentration. A look of pain crossed
her face, and then, as her expression
smoothed again, she said: "The traitors
are dead. All except one, and
he's&mdash;" She paused. "He's dying," she
finished. "He can't hurt you."</p>

<p>There was no need for further battle.
Malone reholstered his .44 and
turned to Boyd. "Tom, call the State
Police," he said. "Get 'em down here
fast."</p>

<p>He waited while Boyd climbed back
under the wheel and began punching
buttons on the dashboard. Then Malone
went toward the burning Buick.</p>

<p>He tried to drag the men out, but
it wasn't any use. The first two, in the
front seat, had the kind of holes in
them people talked about throwing
elephants through. Head and chest
had been hit.</p>

<p>Malone couldn't get close enough
to the fiercely blazing automobile to
make even a try for the men in the
back seat.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He was sitting quietly on the edge
of the rear seat when the Nevada
Highway Patrol cars drove up next to
them. Barbara Wilson had stopped
screaming, but she was still sobbing on
Malone's shoulder. "It's all right," he
told her, feeling ineffectual.</p>

<p>"I never saw anybody killed before,"
she said.</p>

<p>"It's all right," Malone said.
"Nothing's going to hurt you. I'll
protect you."</p>

<p>He wondered if he meant it, and
found, to his surprise, that he did.
Barbara Wilson sniffled and looked up
at him. "Mr. Malone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ken," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said. "Ken&mdash;I'm
so afraid. I saw the hole in one of the
men's heads, when you fired ... it
was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't think about it," Malone
said. To him, the job had been an
unpleasant occurrence, but a job, that
was all. He could see, though, how
it might affect people who were new
to it.</p>

<p>"You're so brave," she said.</p>

<p>Malone tightened his arm around
the girl's shoulder. "Just depend on
me," he said. "You'll be all right if
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The State Trooper walked up then,
and looked at them. "Mr. Malone?"
he said. He seemed to be taken slightly
aback at the costuming.</p>

<p>"That's right," Malone said. He
pulled out his ID card and the little
golden badge. The State Patrolman
looked at them, and looked back at
Malone.</p>

<p>"What's with the getup?" he said.</p>

<p>"FBI," Malone said, hoping his
voice carried conviction. "Official
business."</p>

<p>"In costume?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about the details,"
Malone snapped.</p>

<p>"He's an FBI agent, sir," Barbara
said.</p>

<p>"And what are you?" the Patrolman
said. "Lady Jane Grey?"</p>

<p>"I'm a nurse," Barbara said. "A
psychiatric nurse."</p>

<p>"For nuts?"</p>

<p>"For disturbed patients."</p>

<p>The patrolman thought that over.
"You've got the identity cards and
stuff," he said at last. "Maybe you've
got a reason to dress up. How would
I know? I'm only a State Patrolman."</p>

<p>"Let's cut the monologue," Malone
said savagely, "and get to business."</p>

<p>The patrolman stared. Then he
said: "All right, sir. Yes, sir. I'm
Lieutenant Adams, Mr. Malone. Suppose
you tell me what happened?"</p>

<p>Carefully and concisely, Malone
told him the story of the Buick that
had pulled up beside them, and what
had happened afterward.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other cops had been
looking over the wreck. When Malone
had finished his story, Lieutenant
Adams flipped his notebook shut and
looked over toward them. "I guess it's
O.K., sir," he said. "As far as I'm
concerned, it's justifiable homicide.
Self-defense. Any reason why they'd
want to kill you?"</p>

<p>Malone thought about the Golden
Palace. That might be a reason&mdash;but
it might not. And why burden an innocent
State Patrolman with the facts
of FBI life?</p>

<p>"Official," he said. "Your chief will
get the report."</p>

<p>The patrolman nodded. "I'll have
to take a deposition tomorrow, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," Malone said. "Thanks.
Can we go on to our hotel now?"</p>

<p>"I guess," the patrolman said. "Go
ahead. We'll take care of the rest of
this. You'll be getting a call later."</p>

<p>"Fine," Malone said. "Trace those
hoods, and any connections they might
have had. Get the information to me
as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Adams nodded. "You
won't have to leave the state, will
you?" he asked. "I don't mean that
you <i>can't</i>, exactly ... hell, you're
FBI. But it'd be easier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call Burris in Washington," Malone
said. "He can get hold of me&mdash;and
if the Governor wants to know
where we are, or the State's Attorney,
put them in touch with Burris, too.
O.K.?"</p>

<p>"O.K.," Lieutenant Adams said.
"Sure." He blinked at Malone. "Listen,"
he said. "About those costumes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're trying to catch Henry VIII
for the murder of Anne Boleyn," Malone
said with a polite smile. "O.K.?"</p>

<p>"I was only asking," Lieutenant
Adams said. "Can't blame a man for
asking, now, can you?"</p>

<p>Malone climbed into his front seat.
"Call me later," he said. The car
started. "Back to the hotel, Sir
Thomas," Malone said, and the car
roared off.</p>



<hr class="hrchp" />
<h2>VII</h2>


<p>Yucca Flats, Malone thought, certainly
deserved its name. It was about
as flat as land could get, and it contained
millions upon millions of useless
yuccas. Perhaps they were good
for something, Malone thought, but
they weren't good for <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>The place might, of course, have
been called Cactus Flats, but the cacti
were neither as big nor as impressive
as the yuccas.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/010.png" width="430" height="500" alt="" title="" />
"I knight thee Sir Andrew...."</div>



<p>Or was that yucci?</p>

<p>Possibly, Malone mused, it was
simply yucks.</p>

<p>And whatever it was, there were
millions of it. Malone felt he couldn't
stand the sight of another yucca. He
was grateful for only one thing.</p>

<p>It wasn't summer. If the Elizabethans
had been forced to drive in closed
cars through the Nevada desert in the
summertime, they might have started
a cult of nudity, Malone felt. It was
bad enough now, in what was supposed
to be winter.</p>

<p>The sun was certainly bright
enough, for one thing. It glared
through the cloudless sky and glanced
with blinding force off the road. Sir
Thomas Boyd squinted at it through
the rather incongruous sunglasses he
was wearing, while Malone wondered
idly if it was the sunglasses, or the
rest of the world, that was an anachronism.
But Sir Thomas kept his eyes
grimly on the road as he gunned the
powerful Lincoln toward the Yucca
Flats Labs at eighty miles an
hour.</p>

<p>Malone twisted himself around and
faced the women in the back seat. Past
them, through the rear window of the
Lincoln, he could see the second car.
It followed them gamely, carrying the
newest addition to Sir Kenneth Malone's
Collection of Bats.</p>

<p>"Bats?" Her Majesty said suddenly,
but gently. "Shame on you, Sir
Kenneth. These are poor, sick people.
We must do our best to help them&mdash;not
to think up silly names for them.
For shame!"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Malone said wearily.
He sighed and, for the fifth time
that day, he asked: "Does Your Majesty
have any idea where our spy is
now?"</p>

<p>"Well, really, Sir Kenneth," the
Queen said with the slightest of hesitations,
"it isn't easy, you know. Telepathy
has certain laws, just like
everything else. After all, even a
game has laws. Being telepathic did
not help me to play poker&mdash;I still had
to learn the rules. And telepathy has
rules, too. A telepath can easily confuse
another telepath by using some
of those rules."</p>

<p>"Oh, fine," Malone said. "Well,
have you got into contact with his
mind yet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Her Majesty said happily.
"And my goodness, he's certainly
digging up a lot of information,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>Malone moaned softly. "But who
<i>is</i> he?" he asked after a second.</p>

<p>The Queen stared at the roof of
the car in what looked like concentration.
"He hasn't thought of his
name yet," she said. "I mean, at least
if he has, he hasn't mentioned it to
me. Really, Sir Kenneth, you have no
idea how difficult all this is."</p>

<p>Malone swallowed with difficulty.
"<i>Where</i> is he, then?" he said. "Can
you tell me that, at least? His location?"</p>

<p>Her Majesty looked positively desolated
with sadness. "I can't be sure,"
she said. "I really can't be exactly
sure just where he is. He does keep
moving around, I know that. But you
have to remember that he doesn't want
me to find him. He certainly doesn't
want to be found by the FBI ...
would you?"</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," Malone said, "I
<i>am</i> the FBI."</p>

<p>"Yes," the Queen said, "but suppose
you weren't? He's doing his best
to hide himself, even from me. It's
sort of a game he's playing."</p>

<p>"A game!"</p>

<p>Her Majesty looked contrite. "Believe
me, Sir Kenneth, the minute I
know exactly where he is, I'll tell you.
I promise. Cross my heart and hope
to die&mdash;which I can't, of course, being
immortal." Nevertheless, she made an
X-mark over her left breast. "All
right?"</p>

<p>"All right," Malone said, out of
sheer necessity. "O.K. But don't waste
any time telling me. Do it right away.
We've <i>got</i> to find that spy and isolate
him somehow."</p>

<p>"Please don't worry yourself, Sir
Kenneth," Her Majesty said. "Your
Queen is doing everything she can."</p>

<p>"I know that, Your Majesty," Malone
said. "I'm sure of it." Privately,
he wondered just how much even she
could do. Then he realized&mdash;for perhaps
the ten-thousandth time&mdash;that
there was no such thing as wondering
privately any more.</p>

<p>"That's quite right, Sir Kenneth,"
the Queen said sweetly. "And it's
about time you got used to it."</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Boyd said.
"More reading minds back there?"</p>

<p>"That's right, Sir Thomas," the
Queen said.</p>

<p>"I've about gotten used to it," Boyd
said almost cheerfully. "Pretty soon
they'll come and take me away, but I
don't mind at all." He whipped the
car around a bend in the road savagely.
"Pretty soon they'll put me with
the other sane people and let the bats
inherit the world. But I don't mind
at all."</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas!" Her Majesty said in
shocked tones.</p>

<p>"Please," Boyd said with a deceptive
calmness. "Just Mr. Boyd. Not
even Lieutenant Boyd, or Sergeant
Boyd. Just Mr. Boyd. Or, if you prefer,
Tom."</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas," Her Majesty said,
"I really can't understand this sudden&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then don't understand it," Boyd
said. "All I know is everybody's nuts,
and I'm sick and tired of it."</p>

<p>A pall of silence fell over the company.</p>

<p>"Look, Tom," Malone began at
last.</p>

<p>"Don't you try smoothing me
down," Boyd snapped.</p>

<p>Malone's eyebrows rose. "O.K.,"
he said. "I won't smooth you down.
I'll just tell you to shut up, to keep
driving&mdash;and to show some respect to
Her Majesty."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" Boyd stopped. There was a
second of silence.</p>

<p>"<i>That's</i> better," Her Majesty said
with satisfaction.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara stretched in the back
seat, next to Her Majesty. "This is
certainly a long drive," she said.
"Have we got much farther to go?"</p>

<p>"Not too far," Malone said. "We
ought to be there soon."</p>

<p>"I ... I'm sorry for the way I
acted," Barbara said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, the way you
acted?"</p>

<p>"Crying like that," Barbara said
with some hesitation. "Making an&mdash;absolute
idiot of myself. When that
other car&mdash;tried to get us."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it," Malone
said. "It was nothing."</p>

<p>"I just&mdash;made trouble for you,"
Barbara said.</p>

<p>Her Majesty touched the girl on the
shoulder. "He's not thinking about
the trouble you cause him," she said
quietly.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm not," Malone told
her.</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear girl," Her Majesty said,
"I believe that Sir Kenneth is, at least
partly, in love with you."</p>

<p>Malone blinked. It was perfectly
true&mdash;even if he hadn't quite known
it himself until now. Telepaths, he
was discovering, were occasionally
handy things to have around.</p>

<p>"In ... love&mdash;" Barbara said.</p>

<p>"And you, my dear&mdash;" Her Majesty
began.</p>

<p>"Please, Your Majesty," Lady Barbara
said. "No more. Not just now."</p>

<p>The Queen smiled, almost to herself.
"Certainly, dear," she said.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The car sped on. In the distance,
Malone could see the blot on the desert
that indicated the broad expanse
of Yucca Flats Labs. Just the fact that
it could be seen, he knew, didn't
mean an awful lot. Malone had been
able to see it for the past fifteen minutes,
and it didn't look as if they'd
gained an inch on it. Desert distances
are deceptive.</p>

<p>At long last, however, the main
gate of the laboratories hove into
view. Boyd made a left turn off the
highway and drove a full seven miles
along the restricted road, right up to
the big gate that marked the entrance
of the laboratories themselves. Once
again, they were faced with the army
of suspicious guards and security officers.</p>

<p>This time, suspicion was somewhat
heightened by the dress of the visitors.
Malone had to explain about six times
that the costumes were part of an FBI
arrangement, that he had not stolen
his identity cards, that Boyd's cards
were Boyd's, too, and in general that
the four of them were not insane, not
spies, and not jokesters out for a lark
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Malone had expected all of that.
He went through the rigmarole wearily
but without any sense of surprise.
The one thing he hadn't been expecting
was the man who was waiting for
him on the other side of the
gate.</p>

<p>When he'd finished identifying
everybody for the fifth or sixth time,
he began to climb back into the car.
A familiar voice stopped him cold.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Malone," Andrew
J. Burris said. He erupted from the
guardhouse like an avenging angel,
followed closely by a thin man, about
five feet ten inches in height, with
brush-cut brown hair, round horn-rimmed
spectacles, large hands and
a small Sir Francis Drake beard. Malone
looked at the two figures blankly.</p>

<p>"Something wrong, chief?" he said.</p>

<p>Burris came toward the car. The
thin gentleman followed him, walking
with an odd bouncing step that must
have been acquired, Malone thought,
over years of treading on rubber eggs.
"I don't know," Burris said when
he'd reached the door. "When I was
in Washington, I seemed to know&mdash;but
when I get out here in this desert,
everything just goes haywire." He
rubbed at his forehead.</p>

<p>Then he looked into the car.
"Hello, Boyd," he said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Hello, chief," Boyd said.</p>

<p>Burris blinked. "Boyd, you look
like Henry VIII," he said with only
the faintest trace of surprise.</p>

<p>"Doesn't he, though?" Her Majesty
said from the rear seat. "I've noticed
that resemblance myself."</p>

<p>Burris gave her a tiny smile. "Oh,"
he said. "Hello, Your Majesty. I'm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Andrew J. Burris, Director of the
FBI," the Queen finished for him.
"Yes, I know. It's very nice to meet
you at last. I've seen you on television,
and over the video phone. You
photograph badly, you know."</p>

<p>"I do?" Burris said pleasantly. It
was obvious that he was keeping himself
under very tight control.</p>

<p>Malone felt remotely sorry for the
man&mdash;but only remotely. Burris might
as well know, he thought, what they
had all been going through the past
several days.</p>

<p>Her Majesty was saying something
about the honorable estate of knighthood,
and the Queen's List. Malone
began paying attention when she
came to: "... And I hereby dub
thee&mdash;" She stopped suddenly, turned
and said: "Sir Kenneth, give me your
weapon."</p>

<p>Malone hesitated for a long, long
second. But Burris' eye was on him,
and he could interpret the look without
much trouble. There was only one
thing for him to do. He pulled out
his .44, ejected the remaining cartridge
in his palm&mdash;and reminded
himself to reload the gun as soon as
he got it back&mdash;and handed the weapon
to the Queen, butt foremost.</p>

<p>She took the butt of the revolver
in her right hand, leaned out the window
of the car, and said in a fine,
distinct voice: "Kneel, Andrew."</p>

<p>Malone watched with wide, astonished
eyes as Andrew J. Burris, Director
of the FBI, went to one knee
in a low and solemn genuflection.
Queen Elizabeth Thompson nodded
her satisfaction.</p>

<p>She tapped Burris gently on each
shoulder with the muzzle of the gun.
"I knight thee Sir Andrew," she said.
She cleared her throat. "My, this desert
air is dry&mdash;Rise, Sir Andrew, and
know that you are henceforth Knight
Commander of the Queen's Own
FBI."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Your Majesty," Burris
said humbly.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet silently. The
Queen withdrew into the car again and
handed the gun back to Malone. He
thumbed cartridges into the chambers
of the cylinder and listened dumbly.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," Burris said, "this
is Dr. Harry Gamble, the head of
Project Isle. Dr. Gamble, this is Her
Majesty the Queen; Lady Barbara
Wilson, her ... uh ... her lady in
waiting; Sir Kenneth Malone; and
King ... I mean Sir Thomas Boyd."
He gave the four a single bright impartial
smile. Then he tore his eyes
away from the others, and bent his
gaze on Sir Kenneth Malone. "Come
over here a minute, Malone," he said,
jerking his thumb over his shoulder.
"I want to talk to you."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Malone climbed out of the car and
went around to meet Burris. He felt
just a little worried as he followed the
Director away from the car. True, he
had sent Burris a long telegram the
night before, in code. But he hadn't
expected the man to show up at Yucca
Flats. There didn't seem to be any
reason for it.</p>

<p>And when there isn't any reason,
Malone told himself sagely, it's a bad
one.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, chief?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Burris sighed. "None so far," he
said quietly. "I got a report from the
Nevada State Patrol, and ran it
through R&amp;I. They identified the men
you killed, all right&mdash;but it didn't
do us any good. They're hired
hoods."</p>

<p>"Who hired them?" Malone said.</p>

<p>Burris shrugged. "Somebody with
money," he said. "Hell, men like that
would kill their own grandmothers if
the price were right&mdash;you know that.
We can't trace them back any farther."</p>

<p>Malone nodded. That was, he had
to admit, bad news. But then, when
had he last had any good news?</p>

<p>"We're nowhere near our telepathic
spy," Burris said. "We haven't come
any closer than we were when we
started. Have you got anything? Anything
at all, no matter how small?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of, sir," Malone
said.</p>

<p>"What about the little old lady ... what's
her name? Thompson. Anything
from her?"</p>

<p>Malone hesitated. "She has a close
fix on the spy, sir," he said slowly,
"but she doesn't seem able to identify
him right away."</p>

<p>"What else does she want?" Burris
said. "We've made her Queen and
given her a full retinue in costume;
we've let her play roulette and poker
with Government money. Does she
want to hold a mass execution? If
she does, I can supply some congressmen,
Malone. I'm sure it could be
arranged." He looked at the agent
narrowly. "I might even be able to
supply an FBI man or two," he added.</p>

<p>Malone swallowed hard. "I'm trying
the best I can, sir," he said.
"What about the others?"</p>

<p>Burris looked even unhappier than
usual. "Come along," he said. "I'll
show you."</p>

<p>When they got back to the car, Dr.
Gamble was talking spiritedly with
Her Majesty about Roger Bacon. "Before
my time, of course," the Queen
was saying, "but I'm sure he was a
most interesting man. Now when dear
old Marlowe wrote his 'Faust,' he
and I had several long discussions
about such matters. Alchemy&mdash;"</p>

<p>Burris interrupted with: "I beg
your pardon, Your Majesty, but we
must get on. Perhaps you'll be able
to continue your ... ah ... audience
later." He turned to Boyd. "Sir
Thomas," he said with an effort,
"drive directly to the Westinghouse
buildings. Over that way." He pointed.
"Dr. Gamble will ride with you,
and the rest of us will follow in the
second car. Let's move."</p>

<p>He stepped back as the project head
got into the car, and watched it roar
off. Then he and Malone went to the
second car, another FBI Lincoln. Two
agents were sitting in the back seat,
with a still figure between them.</p>

<p>With a shock, Malone recognized
William Logan and the agents he'd
detailed to watch the telepath. Logan's
face did not seem to have changed
expression since Malone had seen it
last, and he wondered wildly if perhaps
it had to be dusted once a
week.</p>

<p>He got in behind the wheel and
Burris slid in next to him.</p>

<p>"Westinghouse." Burris said. "And
let's get there in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Right," Malone said, and started
the car.</p>

<p>"We just haven't had a single
lead," Burris said. "I was hoping
you'd come up with something. Your
telegram detailed the fight, of course,
and the rest of what's been happening&mdash;but
I hoped there'd be something
more."</p>

<p>"There isn't," Malone was forced
to admit. "All we can do is try to
persuade Her Majesty to tell us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know it isn't easy," Burris
said. "But it seems to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>By the time they'd arrived at the
administrative offices of Westinghouse's
psionics research area, Malone
found himself wishing that something
would happen. Possibly, he thought,
lightning might strike, or an earthquake
swallow everything up. He was,
suddenly, profoundly tired of the entire
affair.</p>



<hr class="hrchp" />
<h2>VIII</h2>


<p>Four days later, he was more than
tired. He was exhausted. The six psychopaths&mdash;including
Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth I&mdash;had been housed
in a converted dormitory in the Westinghouse
area, together with four
highly nervous and even more highly
trained and investigated psychiatrists
from St. Elizabeths in Washington.
The Convention of Nuts, as Malone
called it privately, was in full swing.
And it was every bit as strange as
he'd thought it was going to be. Unfortunately,
five of the six&mdash;Her Majesty
being the only exception&mdash;were
completely out of contact with the
world. The psychiatrists referred to
them in worried tones as "unavailable
for therapy," and spent most of their
time brooding over possible ways of
bringing them back into the real world
for a while.</p>

<p>Malone stayed away from the five
who were completely psychotic. The
weird babblings of fifty-year-old Barry
Miles disconcerted him. They sounded
like little Charlie O'Neill's strange
semi-connected jabber, but Westinghouse's
Dr. O'Connor said that it
seemed to represent another phenomenon
entirely. William Logan's blank
face was a memory of horror, but the
constant tinkling giggles of Ardith
Parker, the studied and concentrated
way that Gordon Macklin wove meaningless
patterns in the air with his
waving fingers, and the rhythmless,
melodyless humming that seemed to
be all there was to the personality of
Robert Cassiday were simply too
much for Malone. Taken singly, each
was frightening and remote; all together,
they wove a picture of insanity
that chilled him more than he
wanted to admit.</p>

<p>When the seventh telepath was
flown in from Honolulu, Malone
didn't even bother to see her. He let
the psychiatrists take over directly,
and simply avoided their sessions.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth I, on the other
hand, he found genuinely likeable.
According to the psych boys, she had
been&mdash;as both Malone and Her Majesty
had theorized&mdash;heavily frustrated
by being the possessor of a talent
which no one else recognized. Beyond
that, the impact of other minds was
disturbing; there was a slight loss of
identity which seemed to be a major
factor in every case of telepathic insanity.
But the Queen had compensated
for her frustrations in the easiest
possible way; she had simply
traded her identity for another one,
and had rationalized a single, over-ruling
delusion: that she was Queen
Elizabeth I of England, still alive
and wrongfully deprived of her
throne.</p>

<p>"It's a beautiful rationalization,"
one of the psychiatrists said with more
than a trace of admiration in his
voice. "Complete and thoroughly consistent.
She's just traded identities&mdash;and
everything else she does&mdash;<i>everything</i>
else&mdash;stems logically out of her
delusional premise. Beautiful."</p>

<p>She might have been crazy, Malone
realized. But she was a long way from
stupid.</p>

<p>The project was in full swing. The
only trouble was that they were no
nearer finding the telepath than they
had been three weeks before. With
five completely blank human beings
to work with, and the sixth Queen
Elizabeth (Malone heard privately
that the last telepath, the girl from
Honolulu, was no better than the first
five; she had apparently regressed into
what one of the psychiatrists called a
"non-identity childhood syndrome."
Malone didn't know what it meant,
but it sounded terrible.) Malone
could see why progress was their most
difficult commodity.</p>

<p>Dr. Harry Gamble, the head of
Project Isle, was losing poundage by
the hour with worry. And, Malone
reflected, he could ill afford it.</p>

<p>Burris, Malone and Boyd had set
themselves up in a temporary office
within the Westinghouse area. The
director had left his assistant in
charge in Washington. Nothing, he
said over and over again, was as important
as the spy in Project Isle.</p>

<p>Apparently Boyd had come to believe
that, too. At any rate, though he
was still truculent, there were no
more outbursts of rebellion.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>But, on the fourth day:</p>

<p>"What do we do now?" Burris
asked.</p>

<p>"Shoot ourselves," Boyd said
promptly.</p>

<p>"Now, look here&mdash;" Malone began,
but he was overruled.</p>

<p>"Boyd," Burris said levelly, "if I
hear any more of that sort of pessimism,
you're going to be an exception
to the beard rule. One more
crack out of you, and you can go out
and buy yourself a razor."</p>

<p>Boyd put his hand over his chin
protectively, and said nothing at
all.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Malone said.
"Aren't there any <i>sane</i> telepaths in
the world?"</p>

<p>"We can't find any," Burris said.
"We&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a knock at the office
door.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" Burris called.</p>

<p>"Dr. Gamble," said the man's
surprisingly baritone voice.</p>

<p>Burris called: "Come in, doctor,"
and the door opened. Dr. Gamble's
lean face looked almost haggard.</p>

<p>"Mr. Burris," he said, extending
his arms a trifle, "can't anything be
done?" Malone had seen Gamble
speaking before, and had wondered
if it would be possible for the man
to talk with his hands tied behind
his back. Apparently it wouldn't be.
"We feel that we are approaching a
critical stage in Project Isle," the scientist
said, enclosing one fist within
the other hand. "If anything more
gets out to the Soviets, we might as
well publish our findings"&mdash;a wide,
outflung gesture of both arms&mdash;"in
the newspapers."</p>

<p>Burris stepped back. "We're doing
the best we can, Dr. Gamble," he
said. All things considered, his obvious
try at radiating confidence was
nearly successful. "After all," he
went on, "we know a great deal more
than we did four days ago. Miss
Thompson has assured us that the spy
is right here, within the compound
of Yucca Flats Labs. We've bottled
everything up in this compound, and
I'm confident that no information is
at present getting through to the
Soviet Government. Miss Thompson
agrees with me."</p>

<p>"Miss Thompson?" Gamble said,
one hand at his bearded chin.</p>

<p>"The Queen," Burris said.</p>

<p>Gamble nodded and two fingers
touched his forehead. "Ah," he said.
"Of course." He rubbed at the back
of his neck. "But we can't keep everybody
who's here now locked up forever.
Sooner or later we'll have to let
them"&mdash;his left hand described the
gesture of a man tossing away a wad
of paper&mdash;"go." His hands fell to his
sides. "We're lost, unless we can find
that spy."</p>

<p>"We'll find him," Burris said with
a show of great confidence.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Give her time," Burris said. "Give
her time. Remember her mental condition."</p>

<p>Boyd looked up. "Rome," he said
in an absent fashion, "wasn't built in
a daze."</p>

<p>Burris glared at him, but said nothing.
Malone filled the conversational
hole with what he thought would be
nice, and hopeful, and untrue.</p>

<p>"We know he's someone on the
reservation, so we'll catch him eventually,"
he said. "And as long as his
information isn't getting into Soviet
hands, we're safe." He glanced at his
wrist watch.</p>

<p>Dr. Gamble said: "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My, my," Malone said. "Almost
lunchtime. I have to go over and have
lunch with Her Majesty. Maybe she's
dug up something more."</p>

<p>"I hope so," Dr. Gamble said, apparently
successfully deflected. "I do
hope so."</p>

"One more crack out of you...."</div>



<p>"Well," Malone said, "pardon
me." He shucked off his coat and
trousers. Then he proceeded to put
on the doublet and hose that hung in
the little office closet. He shrugged
into the fur-trimmed, slash-sleeved
coat, adjusted the plumed hat to his
satisfaction with great care, and gave
Burris and the others a small bow.
"I go to an audience with Her Majesty,
gentlemen," he said in a grave,
well-modulated voice. "I shall return
anon."</p>

<p>He went out the door and closed
it carefully behind him. When he had
gone a few steps he allowed himself
the luxury of a deep sigh.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Then he went outside and across
the dusty street to the barracks where
Her Majesty and the other telepaths
were housed. No one paid any attention
to him, and he rather missed the
stares he'd become used to drawing.
But by now, everyone was used to
seeing Elizabethan clothing. Her Majesty
had arrived at a new plateau.</p>

<p>She would now allow no one to
have audience with her unless he was
properly dressed. Even the psychiatrists&mdash;whom
she had, with a careful
sense of meiosis, appointed Physicians
to the Royal House&mdash;had to wear the
stuff.</p>

<p>Malone went over the whole case
in his mind&mdash;for about the thousandth
time, he told himself bitterly.</p>

<p>Who could the telepathic spy be? It
was like looking for a needle in a
rolling stone, he thought. Or something.
He did remember clearly that
a stitch in time saved nine, but he
didn't know nine what, and suspected
it had nothing to do with his present
problem.</p>

<p>How about Dr. Harry Gamble,
Malone thought. It seemed a little
unlikely that the head of Project Isle
would be spying on his own men&mdash;particularly
since he already had all
the information. But, on the other
hand, he was just as probable a spy
as anybody else.</p>

<p>Malone moved onward. Dr. Thomas
O'Connor, the Westinghouse
psionics man, was the next nominee.
Before Malone had actually found
Her Majesty, he had had a suspicion
that O'Connor had cooked the whole
thing up to throw the FBI off the
trail and confuse everybody, and that
he'd intended merely to have the FBI
chase ghosts while the real spy did
his work undetected.</p>

<p>But what if O'Connor were the spy
himself&mdash;a telepath? What if he were
so confident of his ability to throw
the Queen off the track that he had
allowed the FBI to find all the other
telepaths? There was another argument
for that: he'd had to report the
findings of his machine no matter
what it cost him; there were too many
other men on his staff who knew
about it.</p>

<p>O'Connor was a perfectly plausible
spy, too. But he didn't seem very likely.
The head of a Government project
is likely to be a much-investigated
man. Could any tie-up with Russia&mdash;even
a psionic one&mdash;stand against
that kind of investigation? Malone
doubted it.</p>

<p>Malone thought of the psychiatrists.
There wasn't any evidence, that
was the trouble. There wasn't any
evidence either way.</p>

<p>Then he wondered if Boyd had
been thinking of him, Malone, as the
possible spy. Certainly it worked in
reverse. Boyd&mdash;</p>

<p>No. That was silly.</p>

<p>Malone told himself that he might
as well consider Andrew J. Burris.</p>

<p>Ridiculous. Absolutely ridic&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, Queen Elizabeth had seemed
pretty certain when she'd pointed him
out in Dr. Dowson's office. And even
though she'd changed her mind, how
much faith could be placed in Her
Majesty? After all, if she'd made a
mistake about Burris, she could just
as easily have made a mistake about
the spy's being at Yucca Flats. In that
case, Malone thought sadly, they were
right back where they'd started from.</p>

<p>Behind their own goal line.</p>

<p>One way or another, though, Her
Majesty had made a mistake. She'd
pointed Burris out as the spy, and
then she'd said she'd been wrong.
Either Burris was a spy or he wasn't.
You couldn't have it both ways.</p>

<p>Why couldn't you? Malone
thought suddenly. And then something
Burris himself had said came
back to him, something that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>I'll be damned</i>, he thought.</p>

<p>He came to a dead stop in the
middle of the street. In one sudden
flash of insight, all the pieces of the
case he'd been looking at for so long
fell together and formed one consistent
picture. The pattern was complete.</p>

<p>Malone blinked.</p>

<p>In that second, he knew exactly
who the spy was.</p>

<p>A jeep honked raucously and
swerved around him. The driver leaned
out to curse and remained to stare.
Malone was already halfway back to
the offices.</p>

<p>On the way, he stopped in at another
small office, this one inhabited
by the two FBI men from Las Vegas.
He gave a series of quick orders, and
got the satisfaction, as he left, of
seeing one of the FBI men grabbing
for a phone in a hurry. It was good
to be <i>doing</i> things again, important
things.</p>

<p>Burris, Boyd and Dr. Gamble were
still talking as Malone entered.</p>

<p>"That," Burris said, "was one hell
of a quick lunch. What's Her Majesty
doing now&mdash;running a diner?"</p>

<p>Malone ignored the bait. "Gentlemen,"
he said solemnly, "Her Majesty
has asked that all of us attend
her in audience. She has information
of the utmost gravity to impart, and
wishes an audience at once."</p>

<p>Burris looked startled. "Has
she&mdash;" he began, and stopped, leaving
his mouth open and the rest of
the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>Malone nodded gravely. "I believe,
gentlemen," he said, "that Her Majesty
is about to reveal the identity of
the spy who has been battening on
Project Isle."</p>

<p>The silence didn't last three seconds.</p>

<p>"Let's go," Burris snapped. He and
the others headed for the door.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" Malone sounded
properly shocked and offended.
"Your dress!"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>no</i>," Boyd said. "Not now."</p>

<p>Burris simply said: "You're quite
right. Get dressed, Boyd ... I mean,
of course, Sir Thomas."</p>

<p>While Burris, Boyd and Dr. Gamble
were dressing, Malone put in a
call to Dr. O'Connor and told him
to be at Her Majesty's court in ten
minutes&mdash;and in full panoply.
O'Connor, not unnaturally, balked a
little at first. But Malone talked fast
and sounded as urgent as he felt. At
last he got the psionicist's agreement.</p>

<p>Then he put in a second call to the
psychiatrists from St. Elizabeths and
told them the same thing. More used
to the strange demands of neurotic
and psychotic patients, they were
readier to comply.</p>

<p>Everyone, Malone realized with
satisfaction, was assembled. Even
Burris and the others were ready to
go. Beaming, he led them out.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Ten minutes later, there were nine
men in Elizabethan costume standing
outside the room which had been
designated as the Queen's Court. Dr.
Gamble's costume did not quite fit
him; his sleeve ruffs were halfway up
to his elbows and his doublet had an
unfortunate tendency to creep. The
St. Elizabeths men, all four of them,
looked just a little like moth-eaten
versions of old silent pictures. Malone
looked them over with a somewhat
sardonic eye. Not only did he
have the answer to the whole problem
that had been plaguing them,
but <i>his</i> costume was a stunning, perfect
fit.</p>

<p>"Now, I want you men to let me
handle this," Malone said. "I know
just what I want to say, and I think
I can get the information without too
much trouble."</p>

<p>One of the psychiatrists spoke up.
"I trust you won't disturb the patient,
Mr. Malone," he said.</p>

<p>"Sir Kenneth," Malone snapped.</p>

<p>The psychiatrist looked both
abashed and worried. "I'm sorry," he
said doubtfully.</p>

<p>Malone nodded. "That's all right,"
he said. "I'll try not to disturb Her
Majesty unduly."</p>

<p>The psychiatrists conferred. When
they came out of the huddle one of
them&mdash;Malone was never able to tell
them apart&mdash;said: "Very well, we'll
let you handle it. But we will be
forced to interfere if we feel you're
... ah ... going too far."</p>

<p>Malone said: "That's fair enough,
gentlemen. Let's go."</p>

<p>He opened the door.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent room. The
whole place had been done over in
plastic and synthetic fibers to look like
something out of the Sixteenth Century.
It was as garish, and as perfect,
as a Hollywood movie set&mdash;which
wasn't surprising, since two stage
designers had been hired away from
color-TV spectaculars to set it up. At
the far end of the room, past the rich
hangings and the flaming chandeliers,
was a great throne, and on it Her
Majesty was seated. Lady Barbara
reclined on the steps at her feet.</p>

<p>Malone saw the expression on Her
Majesty's face. He wanted to talk to
Barbara&mdash;but there wasn't time.
Later, there might be. Now, he collected
his mind and drove one
thought at the Queen, one single
powerful thought:</p>

<p><i>Read me! You know by this time
that I have the truth&mdash;but read
deeper!</i></p>

<p>The expression on her face
changed suddenly. She was smiling a
sad, gentle little smile. Lady Barbara,
who had looked up at the approach
of Sir Kenneth and his entourage,
relaxed again, but her eyes remained
on Malone. "You may approach, my
lords," said the Queen.</p>

<p>Sir Kenneth led the procession,
with Sir Thomas and Sir Andrew
close behind him. O'Connor and
Gamble came next, and bringing up
the rear were the four psychiatrists.
They strode slowly along the red
carpet that stretched from the door
to the foot of the throne. They came
to a halt a few feet from the steps
leading up to the throne, and bowed
in unison.</p>

<p>"You may explain, Sir Kenneth,"
Her Majesty said.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty understands the
conditions?" Malone asked.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said the Queen.
"Proceed."</p>

<p>Now the expression on Barbara's
face changed, to wonder and a kind
of fright. Malone didn't look at her.
Instead, he turned to Dr. O'Connor.</p>

<p>"Dr. O'Connor, what are your
plans for the telepaths who have
been brought here?" He shot the
question out quickly, and O'Connor
was caught off-balance.</p>

<p>"Well ... ah ... we would like
their co-operation in further research
which we ... ah ... plan to do
into the actual mechanisms of telepathy.
Provided, of course"&mdash;he
coughed gently&mdash;"provided that they
become ... ah ... accessible. Miss
... I mean, of course, Her Majesty
has ... already been a great deal of
help." He gave Malone an odd look.
It seemed to say: <i>what's coming
next?</i></p>

<p>Malone simply gave him a nod,
and a "Thank you, doctor," and
turned to Burris. He could feel Barbara's
eyes on him, but he went on
with his prepared questions. "Chief,"
he said, "what about you? After we
nail our spy, what happens ... to
Her Majesty, I mean? You don't intend
to stop giving her the homage
due her, do you?"</p>

<p>Burris stared, openmouthed. After
a second he managed to say: "Why,
no, of course not, Sir Kenneth. That
is"&mdash;and he glanced over at the psychiatrists&mdash;"if
the doctors think&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was another hurried consultation.
The four psychiatrists came
out of it with a somewhat shaky
statement to the effect that treatments
which had been proven to have some
therapeutic value ought not to be
discontinued, although of course
there was always the chance that&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you, gentlemen," Malone
said smoothly. He could see that they
were nervous, and no wonder; he
could imagine how difficult it was for
a psychiatrist to talk about a patient
in her presence. But they'd already
realized that it didn't make any difference;
their thoughts were an open
book, anyway.</p>

<p>Lady Barbara said: "Sir ... I mean
Ken ... are you going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's this all about?" Burris
snapped.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Sir Andrew," Malone
said. "I'd like to ask one of the
doctors here&mdash;or all of them, for that
matter&mdash;one more question." He
whirled and faced them. "I'm assuming
that not one of these persons is
legally responsible for his or her actions.
Is that correct?"</p>

<p>Another hurried huddle. The psych
boys were beginning to remind Malone
of a semi-pro football team in
rather unusual uniforms.</p>

<p>Finally one of them said: "You
are correct. According to the latest
statutes, all of these persons are legally
insane&mdash;including Her Majesty."
He paused and gulped. "I except the
FBI, of course&mdash;and ourselves." Another
pause. "And Dr. O'Connor and
Dr. Gamble."</p>

<p>"And," said Lady Barbara, "me."
She smiled sweetly at them all.</p>

<p>"Ah," the psychiatrist said. "Certainly.
Of course." He retired into his
group with some confusion.</p>

<p>Malone was looking straight at the
throne. Her Majesty's countenance
was serene and unruffled.</p>

<p>Barbara said suddenly: "You don't
mean ... but she&mdash;" and closed her
mouth. Malone shot her one quick
look, and then turned to the
Queen.</p>

<p>"Well, Your Majesty?" he said.
"You have seen the thoughts of every
man here. How do they appear to
you?"</p>

<p>Her voice contained both tension
and relief. "They are all good men,
basically&mdash;and kind men," she said.
"And they believe us. That's the important
thing, you know. Their belief
in us&mdash; Just as you did that first day
we met. We've needed belief for so
long ... for so long&mdash;" Her voice
trailed off; it seemed to become lost
in a constellation of thoughts. Barbara
had turned to look up at Her
Majesty.</p>

<p>Malone took a step forward, but
Burris interrupted him. "How about
the spy?" he said.</p>

<p>Then his eyes widened. Boyd,
standing next to him, leaned suddenly
forward. "That's why you mentioned
all that about legal immunity
because of insanity," he whispered.
"Because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," Barbara said. "No. She
couldn't ... she's not&mdash;"</p>

<p>They were all looking at Her Majesty,
now. She returned them stare
for stare, her back stiff and straight
and her white hair enhaloed in the
room's light. "Sir Kenneth," she said&mdash;and
her voice was only the least
bit unsteady&mdash;"they all think <i>I'm</i> the
spy."</p>

<p>Barbara stood up. "Listen," she
said. "I didn't like Her Majesty at
first ... well, she was a patient, and
that was all, and when she started
putting on airs ... but since I've
gotten to know her I do like her. I
like her because she's good and kind
herself, and because ... because she
wouldn't be a spy. She couldn't be.
No matter what any of you think ...
even you ... Sir Kenneth!"</p>

<p>There was a second of silence.</p>

<p>"Of course she's not," Malone said
quietly. "She's no spy."</p>

<p>"Would I spy on my own subjects?"
she said. "Use your reason!"</p>

<p>"You mean...." Burris began, and
Boyd finished for him:</p>

<p>"... She isn't?"</p>

<p>"No," Malone snapped. "She isn't.
Remember, you said it would take a
telepath to catch a telepath?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" Burris began.</p>

<p>"Well, Her Majesty remembered
it," Malone said. "And acted on it."</p>

<p>Barbara remained standing. She
went to the Queen and put an arm
around the little old lady's shoulder.
Her Majesty did not object. "I
knew," she said. "You couldn't have
been a spy."</p>

<p>"Listen, dear," the Queen said.
"Your Kenneth has seen the truth of
the matter. Listen to him."</p>

<p>"Her Majesty not only caught the
spy," Malone said, "but she turned
the spy right over to us."</p>

<p>He turned at once and went back
down the long red carpet to the door.
<i>I really ought to get a sword</i>, he
thought, and didn't see Her Majesty
smile. He opened the door with a
great flourish and said quietly:
"Bring him in, boys."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The FBI men from Las Vegas
marched in. Between them was their
prisoner, a boy with a vacuous face,
clad in a strait jacket that seemed to
make no difference at all to him. His
mind was&mdash;somewhere else. But his
body was trapped between the FBI
agents: the body of William Logan.</p>

<p>"Impossible," one of the psychiatrists
said.</p>

<p>Malone spun on his heel and led
the way back to the throne. Logan
and his guards followed closely.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," Malone said,
"may I present the prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly correct, Sir Kenneth,"
the Queen said. "Poor Willie is your
spy. You won't be too hard on him,
will you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. Your Majesty,"
Malone said. "After all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute," Burris exploded.
"How did <i>you</i> know any of
this?"</p>

<p>Malone bowed to Her Majesty, and
winked at Barbara. He turned to Burris.
"Well," he said, "I had one piece
of information none of the rest of you
had. When we were in the Desert
Edge Sanitarium, Dr. Dowson called
you on the phone. Remember?"</p>

<p>"Sure I remember," Burris said.
"So?"</p>

<p>"Well," Malone said, "Her Majesty
said she knew just where the spy
was. I asked her where&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me?" Burris
screamed. "You knew all this time
and you didn't tell me?"</p>

<p>"Hold on," Malone said. "I asked
her where&mdash;and she said: 'He's right
there.' And she was pointing right at
your image on the screen."</p>

<p>Burris opened his mouth. Nothing
came out. He closed it and tried
again. At last he managed one word.</p>

<p>"Me?" he said.</p>

<p>"You," Malone said. "But that's
what I realized later. She wasn't
pointing at you. She was pointing at
Logan, who was in the next room."</p>

<p>Barbara whispered: "Is that right,
Your Majesty?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear," the Queen said
calmly. "Would I lie to Sir Kenneth?"</p>

<p>Malone was still talking. "The
thing that set me off this noon was
something you said, Sir Andrew," he
went on. "You said there weren't any
sane telepaths&mdash;remember?"</p>

<p>Burris, incapable of speech, merely
nodded.</p>

<p>"But according to Her Majesty,"
Malone said, "we had every telepath
in the United States right here. She
told me that&mdash;and I didn't even see
it!"</p>

<p>"Don't blame yourself, Sir Kenneth,"
the Queen put in. "I did do
my best to mislead you, you know."</p>

<p>"You sure did!" Malone said.
"And later on, when we were driving
here, you said the spy was 'moving
around.' That's right; he was in the
car behind us, going eighty miles an
hour."</p>

<p>Barbara stared. Malone got a lot of
satisfaction out of that stare. But
there was still more ground to cover.</p>

<p>"Then," he said, "you told us he
was here at Yucca Flats&mdash;after we
brought him here! It had to be one
of the other six telepaths."</p>

<p>The psychiatrist who'd muttered:
"Impossible," was still muttering it.
Malone ignored him.</p>

<p>"And when I remembered her
pointing at you," Malone told Burris,
"and remembered that she'd only
said: 'He's right there,' I knew it
had to be Logan. You weren't there.
You were only an image on a TV
screen. Logan was there&mdash;in the room
behind the phone."</p>

<p>Burris had found his tongue. "All
right," he said. "O.K. But what's all
this about misleading us&mdash;and why
didn't she tell us right away, anyhow?"</p>

<p>Malone turned to Her Majesty on
the throne. "I think that the Queen
had better explain that&mdash;if she will."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Queen Elizabeth Thompson nodded
very slowly. "I ... I only wanted
you to respect me," she said. "To
treat me properly." Her voice sounded
uneven, and her eyes were glistening
with unspilled tears. Lady Barbara
tightened her arm about the Queen's
shoulders once more.</p>

<p>"It's all right," she said. "We do&mdash;respect
you."</p>

<p>The Queen smiled up at her.</p>

<p>Malone waited. After a second Her
Majesty continued.</p>

<p>"I was afraid that as soon as you
found poor Willie you'd send me
back to the hospital," she said. "And
Willie couldn't tell the Russian agents
any more once he'd been taken away.
So I thought I'd just ... just let
things stay the way they were as long
as I could. That's ... that's all."</p>

<p>Malone nodded. After a second he
said: "You see that we couldn't possibly
send you back now, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know all the State Secrets,
Your Majesty," Malone said. "We
would rather that Dr. Harman in San
Francisco didn't try to talk you out
of them. Or anyone else."</p>

<p>The Queen smiled tremulously. "I
know too much, do I?" she said.
Then her grin faded. "Poor Dr. Harman,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Poor Dr. Harman?"</p>

<p>"You'll hear about him in a day or
so," she said. "I ... peeked inside
his mind. He's very ill."</p>

<p>"Ill?" Lady Barbara asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," the Queen said. The
trace of a smile appeared on her face.
"He thinks that all the patients in
the hospital can see inside his mind."</p>

<p>"Oh, my," Lady Barbara said&mdash;and
began to laugh. It was the nicest
sound Malone had ever heard.</p>

<p>"Forget Harman," Burris snapped.
"What about this spy ring? How was
Logan getting his information out?"</p>

<p>"I've already taken care of that,"
Malone said. "I had Desert Edge
Sanitarium surrounded as soon as I
knew what the score was." He looked
at one of the agents holding Logan.</p>

<p>"They ought to be in the Las Vegas
jail within half an hour," the agent
said in confirmation.</p>

<p>"Dr. Dowson was in on it, wasn't
he, Your Majesty?" Malone said.</p>

<p>"Certainly," the Queen said. Her
eyes were suddenly very cold. "I hope
he tries to escape. I hope he tries it."</p>

<p>Malone knew just how she felt.</p>

<p>One of the psychiatrists spoke up
suddenly. "I don't understand it," he
said. "Logan is completely catatonic.
Even if he could read minds, how
could he tell Dowson what he'd read?
It doesn't make sense."</p>

<p>"In the first place," the Queen
said patiently, "Willie isn't catatonic.
He's just <i>busy</i>, that's all. He's only
a boy, and ... well, he doesn't much
like being who he is. So he visits
other people's minds, and that way he
becomes <i>them</i> for a while. You see?"</p>

<p>"Vaguely," Malone said. "But how
did Dowson get his information? I
had everything worked out but that."</p>

<p>"I know you did," the Queen said,
"and I'm proud of you. I intend to
award you with the Order of the
Bath for this day's work."</p>

<p>Unaccountably, Malone's chest
swelled with pride.</p>

<p>"As for Dr. Dowson," the Queen
said, "that traitor ... <i>hurt</i> Willie.
If he's hurt enough, he'll come back."
Her eyes weren't hard any more. "He
didn't want to be a spy, really," she
said, "but he's just a boy, and it must
have sounded rather exciting. He
knew that if he told Dowson everything
he'd found out, they'd let him
go&mdash;go away again."</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>"Well," Malone said, "that about
wraps it up. Any questions?"</p>

<p>He looked around at the men, but
before any of them could speak up
Her Majesty rose.</p>

<p>"I'm sure there are questions," she
said, "but I'm really very tired. My
lords, you are excused." She extended
a hand. "Come, Lady Barbara," she
said. "I think I really may need that
nap, now."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Malone put the cuff links in his
shirt with great care. They were great
stones, and Malone thought that they
gave his costume that necessary Elizabethan
flair.</p>

<p>Not that he was wearing the costume
of the Queen's Court now. Instead,
he was dressed in a tailor-proud
suit of dark blue, a white-on-white
shirt and no tie. He selected one of
a gorgeous peacock pattern from his
closet rack.</p>

<p>Boyd yawned at him from the bed
in the room they were sharing. "Stepping
out?" he said.</p>

<p>"I am," Malone said with restraint.
He whipped the tie round his
neck and drew it under the
collar.</p>

<p>"Anybody I know?"</p>

<p>"I am meeting Lady Barbara, if you
wish to know," Malone said.</p>

<p>"Come down," Boyd said. "Relax.
Anyhow, I've got a question for you.
There was one little thing Her Everlovin'
Majesty didn't explain."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Malone.</p>

<p>"Well, about those hoods who tried
to gun us down," Boyd said. "Who
hired 'em? And why?"</p>

<p>"Dowson," Malone said. "He
wanted to kill us off, and then kidnap
Logan from the hotel room. But we
foiled his plan&mdash;by killing his hoods.
By the time he could work up something
else, we were on our way to
Yucca Flats."</p>

<p>"Great," Boyd said. "And how did
you find out this startling piece of
information? There haven't been any
reports in from Las Vegas, have
there?"</p>

<p>"No," Malone said.</p>

<p>"O.K.," Boyd said. "I give up,
Mastermind."</p>

<p>Malone wished Boyd would stop
using that nickname. The fact was&mdash;as
he, and apparently nobody else,
was willing to recognize&mdash;that he
wasn't anything like a really terrific
FBI agent. Even Barbara thought he
was something special.</p>

<p>He wasn't, he knew.</p>

<p>He was just lucky.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty informed me," Malone
said.</p>

<p>"Her&mdash;" Boyd stood with his
mouth dropped open, like a fish waiting
for some bait. "You mean she
knew?"</p>

<p>"Well," Malone said, "she did
know the guys in the Buick weren't
the best in the business&mdash;and she
knew all about the specially-built FBI
Lincoln. She got that from our
minds." He knotted his tie with an
air of great aplomb, and went, slowly
to the door. "And she knew we were
a good team. She got that from our
minds, too."</p>

<p>"But," Boyd said. After a second
he said: "But," again, and followed
it with: "Why didn't she tell us?"</p>

<p>Malone opened the door.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty wished to see the
Queen's Own FBI in action," said Sir
Kenneth Malone.</p>
